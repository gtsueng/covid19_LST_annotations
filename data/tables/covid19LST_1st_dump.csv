- Bioethics is applied to the rapidly changing circumstances to assist with developing ethical policies, such as immunity passports or new triage procedures. Empirical bioethics research is necessary to explain ethical challenges and to discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the policies enacted to address them.
- Descriptive studies, which discuss current opinions, policies, and procedures, aid in the development of future research and interventions. Such studies should include many different perspectives - e.g. from multiple different frontline workers in and out of healthcare, including those who are at risk or have family members at risk, to assess what these workers believe their professional obligations are during these times.
- Longitudinal studies on moral distress should be conducted, as frontline workers face moral dilemmas as they must care for patients in ways that they were explicitly taught not to (e.g., without proper PPE), causing them to struggle with their decisions in the future.
- Empirical research is necessary to assess whether new practices reflect ethical principles - e.g. whether new triage practices marginalize certain groups, or the benefits and risks of increased use of artificial intelligence.  
- Bioethics research also seeks to address the challenges associated with using human participants to test interventions - e.g. what is an appropriate way to approach potential participants, or should participants be allowed to take on more risk than is normally permitted for human studies?
- The pandemic has raised questions about citizen responsibilities - e.g. responsibility to become vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available, or privacy concerns which present as a result of contact tracing.",[],"Other","Expert Opinion",[]

Analgesia (Table 1):
- Since COVID-19 patients experience pain due to mechanical ventilation, IV fentanyl and IV morphine are conventionally used analgesics. 
- Remifentanil, a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, is an alternative in contingency care and due to its rapid offset, the patient experiences longer pain duration during extubation and post-treatment (p&lt;0.05).
- Sufentanil and alfentanil (5-10 times more potent than fentanyl) are used in crisis care. Sufentanil is available in the sublingual form with 53% bioavailability.
- Conservation strategies include enteral oxycodone/morphine in patients with normal gastrointestinal motility and multimodal analgesic approach.

Sedation (Table 2):
- Dexmedetomidine is suggested for light sedation and propofol is conventionally suggested for deep sedation.
- Propofol can cause hypertriglyceridemia. Since COVID-19 patients may present with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with hypertriglyceridemia, alternatives to propofol should be considered if triglycerides exceed 800mg/dl.
- Ketamine is considered for both light and deep sedation in contingency care, and due to its analgesic effect, it conserves the opioid drug shortages. 
- Non-benzodiazepines are preferred over benzodiazepines and the latter is recommended only in contingency care. Daily awakening trials assessing patients' sedative needs play a vital role in severe drug shortages. 

Paralysis (Table 4):
- Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are preferred in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with moderate-severe ARDS due to their ability to increase chest wall compliance and facilitating lung recruitment.
- Atracurium, rocuronium, vecuronium can be used as alternatives to existing cisatracurium in contingency care and pancuronium in crisis care.

- Critical illness was more common in patients who were older than 65 (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 2.5 to 4.8), male (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.8), had a history of heart failure (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4 to 2.5), and/or had a BMI greater than 40 (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.2). 
- Factors associated with critical illness included an O2 saturation of less than 88% at time of admission (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 2.8 to 4.8), a troponin level greater than 1 (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 2.1 to 10.9), a C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than 200 (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.8 to 9.2), and a D-dimer greater than 2500 (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.6 to 6.0).
The authors conclude by noting that while age and co-morbidities were predictive of hospital admission, oxygen saturation and markers of inflammation may be predictive of critical illness and mortality.","BMJ. 2020 May 22;369:m1966. doi: 10.1136/bmj.m1966.","BMJ","[""Petrilli CM"","" Jones SA"","" Yang J"","" Rajagopalan H"","" O'Donnell L"","" Chernyak Y"","" Tobin KA"","" Cerfolio RJ"","" Francois F"","" Horwitz LI.""]",,[],"3",,

The authors of this article raise additional issues to be considered when using this approach. First, the previous publication suggests reducing the number of patients evaluated for PE during this time by using pretest risk screenings such as the Wells’ criteria, Pulmonary Embolism Ruleout Criteria (PERC) and the Geneva scoring system. However, these tests may not be a sufficient predictor of PE in COVID-19 patients, given severity of illness and greater hemodynamic instability. Therefore, these pretest screenings should be limited to an outpatient setting and only to patients where COVID-19 is not suspected. Second, the previous publication also suggests that for patients with low probability for PE, a combined ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is sufficient for evaluation. However, in COVID-19 patients, as probability for PE is higher, a negative perfusion scan alone cannot exclude PE entirely, and additional studies must be considered to definitively rule out PE.",[],"Other",,

2. Implementation of the Cardiac Hub, a daily ‘virtual’ multidisciplinary team meeting chaired by a surgeon and cardiologist, with colleagues from referring hospitals regarding current cases. Imaging review and risk prediction systems were used to inform discussion.

3. Patients were triaged to one of four categories: urgent (requiring intervention this admission); red elective (intervention required within 3 months); amber elective (intervention deferred for 3- 6 months); or green elective (can wait 6 months).

4. Minimally invasive strategies were chosen where beneficial.

5. Patient education, where those over 70 were specifically advised that contracting COVID-19 would likely be associated with a poor prognosis and those coming from home were asked to shield. 

6. SARS-CoV-2 swabs were taken the day before admission in a drive-through facility on hospital grounds

7. Relevant laboratory tests and a chest CT-scan were performed as close as possible to the time of surgery. If COVID-19 status could not be confirmed, the procedure was performed with full PPE.

8. Surgery was performed by surgeons from the Harefield and other hospitals using a ‘buddy’ system. Patients were extubated, stepped down, discharged as rapidly as possible and advised to self-isolate for 14 days (Figure 1)

9. Pre-operative COVID-19 swabs were obtained in 42(65%) and CT scans performed in 47(70%). (Table 1)

10. Under circumstances of urgency, lack of knowledge or resources over the procedure, where patients came to theatre without test results clinicians relied on clinical history and chest CT as screening tools

11. Post-operative testing was driven by symptoms suspicious for COVID-19

At the transcription step, two scenarios are depicted: to the left, the viral particle resulting from normal S protein, and to the right the viral particle resulting from truncated S. In normal conditions, once the nucleoprotein is freed into the cytoplasm ss+RNA is translated into the non-structural proteins required for transcription. ss+RNA is transcribed into ss-RNA and later into genomic ss+RNA which is encapsidated (left side of the figure). Once the complete viral particle has been formed, it is secreted from the cell by exocytosis. The right side of the figure depicts the situation when a deletion occurs in the S gene during transcription of the complete genome and before subgenomic mRNAs are generated to produce the structural proteins. Translation of a deleted subgenomic spike mRNA would lead to a truncated S protein composed of the S1 domain without S2, which could be shed outside the cell as free S1.

- Origin: The virus appeared to originate in Wuhan, China where it was found to be 99.8-99.9% genetically identical to the beta bat coronavirus. Additionally, the spike gene, which is necessary for binding to the human ACE2 receptor may have been derived from pangolin genes, meaning the pangolin may have been an intermediate host (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 50% identical to MERS-CoV and 80% identical to SARS-CoV.
-Pathogenesis: The SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause pneumonia with ground-glass opacities, cardiac and lung injury, renal failure, diarrhea, and multiple organ failure. The virus is thought to replicate primarily in the upper respiratory tract. Figure 3 provides the current theory of the pathogenesis of this virus.
-Immune Response: Common symptoms from immune response include fever, cough, and fatigue. In severe cases, antibody-dependent enhancement can occur, potentially causing systemic sepsis and inflammation. In cases where patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines were found.
-Genomic variation: Studies have shown 116 unique variations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, most of which were missense (46) or synonymous (52) mutations. 
-Potential treatments: Current treatment guidelines are with antipyretics and analgesics. For severe cases, many drugs are in trial and none have been proven to be effective. Additionally, studies have shown that convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

• The importance in specifying the type of heparin used (UFH or LMWH) as heparin plasma levels exist between heparin testing kits. For instance, the addition of dextran sulphate leads to an overestimation of heparin levels through displacement of heparin from plasma proteins (AT, APR, PF4)

• Unfractionated and Low molecular weight heparin (UFH and LMWH respectively) must be differentiated as they have different effects on laboratory tests.

• Be aware of predisposing conditions such as antithrombin (AT) deficiency. Anti-Xa kits containing exogenous AT can also lead to an overestimation of heparin levels where AT deficiency exists.

• Determination of thrombin generation (TG) must be considered relative to the heparin dose used, and the presence or absence of dextran factored in.

• Heparin resistance and ‘lab resistance’ to heparin must be considered when accounting for normal TG in the face of treatment with therapeutic levels of heparin. Lab resistance to heparin is a failure to achieve therapeutic targets via aPTT or anti-Xa levels despite treatment and is due to low AT levels, high PF4 levels on heparinases or high Factor VIII or fibrinogen levels which can shorten aPTT without an effect on the anti-Xa assay.

• Hardy et al.'s 2020 own study on anti-Xa kits and UFH versus LMWH treatment found a good correlation in anti-Xa levels with both reagents (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.98 for both UFH and LMWH samples) suggesting that regardless of different mechanisms of action, both heparin preparations appear equally effective, despite a detected overestimation of Xa levels where dextran sulphate is present (Figure 1).

• The intrinsic limitations of tests should be considered when choosing tests, such as the presence of dextran sulphate in the testing materials versus those without it. 

• Pre-analytic steps of laboratory tests such as timing of blood collection, centrifugation conditions etc must be considered prior to testing. 

•  For accurate assessment of results, researchers must be transparent about the laboratory methods used in testing.

- Requiring staff to wear surgical masks.
- Screening patients for COVID-19 using history and temperature.
- Performing deliveries in a negative pressure room when available.
- Medication usage: most of the sites reported using corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, magnesium sulfate for COVID-19 patients experiencing preterm labor or preeclampsia, and no use of carboprost. 
- Thromboprophylaxis was initiated at three of the four sites (rationale for this was not stated, but was likely due to presumed increased risk in COVID-19).
- For further details on the above and other policy changes, see Tables 2 and 3. 
- There were significant differences in the sites' policies for checking the fetus in a hospitalized pregnant patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one site starting to check a daily fetal heartbeat at 24 weeks and another site starting at 34 weeks. Half the sites performed daily non-stress tests in addition to fetal heartbeat checks.

SARS-CoV-2 enters neuronal cells through ACE2, as the receptor binding domain, and TMPRSS2 for spike protein (s protein) priming. Next, SARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid triggers clathrin-mediated endocytosis enhancing cytoplasm release. Subsequently, the single negative strand RNA [(−)gRNA] synthesized from (+)gRNA template is used to replicate more copies of viral RNAs. Afterwards, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) synthesized from the (+)gRNA template encode viral structural and accessory proteins, which are subsequently assembled with newly synthesized viral RNAs in the ER and Golgi, followed by budding into the lumen of the ERGIC to form new virions. Then, virus particles are transported in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and released by exocytosis. Furthermore, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into neuronal cells may dysregulate mitochondrial metabolism increasing ROS and leading to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this regard, melatonin’s high difusibility allows it to enter in neuronal cells, it binds to CaM and may act on the Ca2+/CaMKII system, regulating the expression of ACE2, modulating the linking between endoplasmic reticulum stress and infammatory response and scavenging ROS. However, in both MT1/MT2 and α7nAChR receptors, melatonin-mediated signaling may infuence in reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry. When SARS-CoV-2 infects the CNS, it triggers the release of pro-infammatory cytokines. (i) TNF-α, which acts by binding to TNFR receptor recruiting TRADD. This protein binds to TRAF2 to phosphorylate and activate the IKK. Then, IKK complex phosphorylates IKBα, resulting in the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it targets many coding genes for mediators of infammatory responses. (ii) IL-6 induces gene activation in response to cytokine receptor stimulation. STAT3 proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus. JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a crucial link acting as a pivotal mediator of neuroinfammation. (iii) The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR (TLR3/7/9) upregulates the pro-infammatory transcription factor NF-κB and causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by NLRP3 infammasome activation. Consequently, melatonin may revert these pro-infammatory efects by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and NF-κB translocation. In addition, as an anti-infammatory agent, melatonin inhibits the activation of NLRP3 infammasome. Stimulation (blue colored) or inhibition (red colored) by melatonin and SARS-CoV-2 are also shown.

The approach includes screening all residents (n=99) and staff members (n=136) with RT-PCR, serial testing for positive SARS-CoV-2 residents and cohort isolation for those who tested positive (see details below). The authors recommends all SNFs to adopt this approach to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
Positive COVID-19 cases: 
- 8/136 presymptomatic staff members.

""• Parents and carers should incorporate physical activity into children’s daily routine (including using electronic media to facilitate participation) and encourage the whole
family to join while adhering to regulations on physical distancing and access to outdoor
spaces. Extended periods of sitting should be broken up every 30–60 min (eg, by
standing and stretching for 1 min). They should follow sedentary recreational screentime recommendations and encourage co-viewing and positive social interactions and
experiences. To help children to get enough sleep, keep bed and wake times consistent,
keep screens out of the room where children sleep, and avoid screen use before bedtime.
• Educators and teachers should know and promote the movement behaviour
guidelines, and embrace opportunities to incorporate healthy movement messages,
practices, and policies into daily home-school routines and lessons—eg, when
scheduling online lessons, limit prolonged sitting and encourage changes in posture
such as regularly standing, stretching, or moving on the spot.
• Health professionals should understand and recommend the current guidelines to
parents, family members, and caregivers and reinforce their positive association with
children’s health during all visits, including remote contacts and telemedicine.
• Governments should promote healthy movement behaviours in children as part of
response strategies and public messaging, and should engage influential people in
promotion of such messages.
• The media should provide regular messages to promote physical activity and break up
extended periods of sitting.
• Children should speak up and advocate for their right to a healthy, active life, while
carefully observing pandemic restrictions. Forming peer groups can help with

He had a normal high-sensitivity troponin T of &lt;0.03 ng/mL. He was discharged in good condition with 2 negative RT-PCRs and resolution of lung sequelae on CT.

On current presentation, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resolution revealed findings suggestive of active myocarditis. Vitals, 12-lead ECG, and lab findings, including troponin, were otherwise unremarkable except for 37.8°C axillary temperature. The authors suggest the patient's myocarditis may have been a result of residual inflammation from SARS-CoV-2 infection and that cardiac involvement may be overlooked in COVID-19 pneumonia.",[],"5",,

Patients who had COVID-19 or other pneumonia and had CT imaging performed were included in the analysis (n=5372). The majority of these cases (n=4106) were patients with lung cancer who had both CT imaging and EGFR sequencing performed. Data from these patients was used to ""pre-train"" a deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence program. The remaining 1266 cases (n=924 COVID-19 positive, of these n=471 had 5+ days of follow-up; n=342 pneumonia positive/COVID-19 negative) were analyzed in a three step process. 
- A 709 case training set from Wuhan and Henan was used to further train of the DL programming in identification of COVID-19 vs other pneumonia. 
- Four additional data sets of known COVID-19 positive and negative cases were used for validation of this training. 
- Patients with 5+ days of follow up from the Wuhan and Henan training set and the four validations sets were analyzed to determine the prognostic value of the system.
- See figure 1 for details. 
Results from the investigation were as follows:
- The DL system is effectively able to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC = 0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC= 0.86). The DL score showed a significant difference between COVID-19 and other pneumonia groups (p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 3). 
- The DL system is able to designate patients from the COVID-19 dataset (n=471 patients with 5+ days follow-up) into high-risk (p=0.013) and low-risk (p=0.014) groups based on severity of the lung abnormalities on chest CT.  
These findings demonstrate that the automated DL system for analyzing chest CT imaging is helpful in both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. The authors believe this approach will be helpful in optimizing medical resources and early treatment of COVID-19 patients and may identify high-risk groups for special care and prioritization of resources.

•	HEPA filtration is valuable in the filtration of submicron particles, such as SARS-CoV-2
•	Combination HEPA/air recirculation is especially effective in mitigating growth of bacterial colonies and surrogate particulate matters (Table 4)
•	Portable HEPA filtration has shown to help decrease viral load (Table 4)
•	Novel combination of portable HEPA placement, with air discharge into a portable anteroom can both achieve reduction in viral load of a virus while simultaneously achieving the benefit of containment of the virus.

These findings suggest that enhanced air quality can be achieved within healthcare facilities using HEPA filtration methods to enhance patient and worker safety during times of normal functioning and health pandemics.

1. The algorithm will start by only being applied to essential workers (EW) while all other individuals should continue social distancing. This would limit societal exposure and save testing capacity for those on the front lines.

2. All EW who return to work should be tested via serology every 2 weeks. Those with evidence of previous infection would be considered immune and testing can be discontinued. Seronegative individuals would be re-tested every 2 weeks.

3. If an EW has a COVID-19 exposure or symptoms, they should get nasopharyngeal testing for active COVID-19 infection. Those with negative testing will re-enter into the normal serologic testing pathway. 

4. A positive COVID-19 test via nasopharnyngeal swab will result in isolation for 14-21 days followed by serological testing after the infection has passed. If they are immune, they may exit the algorithm. If serological immunity is not seen upon testing, the individual will re-enter the serological testing phase and be tested every 2 weeks.

5. Once greater testing is available, the same algorithm could be used for the general public.",[],"Other","Guidelines and Recommendations",[]

-QT interval should be monitored closely when class IA, IC, and III  antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are administered with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, macrolide, or lopinavir/ritonavir.
-Class IA and IC antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated in COVID-19 patients on fingolimod.
-For patients on fingolimod, recommend obtaining an ECG prior to AAD initiation, ECG at
6 hours after first dose, with periodic ECG and continuous telemetry monitoring.
-β-blockers are recommend as a first-line therapy for rate control.
-Calcium channel blockers is not recommend in myocarditis patients with acute decompensated CHF.
-Digoxin can be used in CHF or in combination with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers to achieve rate control.
-Heparin is the anticoagulant of choice in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AF, especially if patients are being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir.
-Direct oral anticoagulan (DOAC) can be used in AF patients with COVID-19 after discharge without lopinavir/ritonavir.
2. Rhythm control:
-Amiodarone can be useful for rhythm and rate control in critically ill COVID-19 patients with
CHF. Close monitoring with caution is recommended with concurrent lopinavir/ritonavir use.
It is not recommended in patients undergoing treatment with fingolimod
-Flecainide is a preferred option for pharmacological cardioversion in patients with no

1. Infection of peripheral nerves leading to inflammation and trafficking of virions into the CNS (Figure 1)
-SARS-CoV-2 enters CNS via olfactory receptors by binding ACE2 and Neuropilin1 (NRP1) receptors on olfactory epithelium.
- SARS-CoV-2 enters CNS through vagus nerve from lungs and gut via “lung-gut-brain axis”.
- SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 receptors on skeletal muscle and enters CNS via neuromuscular junction by attaching to neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) on motor neurons.

2. Disruption of BBB (Figure 2)
- Paracellular transport of SARS-CoV-2 through leaky BBB via loosening of tight junctions by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
- Transcellular transport via direct endothelial cell invasion leading to vascular leakage and BBB disruption.
- SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 receptors of cerebrovascular endothelial cells and enters CNS via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
- SARS-CoV-2 crosses BBB either by infecting innate cells (monocytes or lymphocytes) or exosome trafficking of viral RNA, known as “a Trojan Horse mechanism”.

Authors hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to development of autoimmune or neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis) as seen in other neurotropic RNA viruses.

•	Dr. Risch noted a 50-fold benefit in this treatment which was never reported in the original study.
•	Dr. Risch noted the effects of the treatment could not be ascribed to confounding, when evidence pointed otherwise.
•	Dr. Risch cited five studies in his publication, however only 2 of these studies contained control groups.

The most prevalent comorbidities, nationally, include obesity (71.5%), hypertension (HTN, 27.7%), and diabetes (9.6%). Many immigrants are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection as they make up a significant portion of the essential workers work force (20% in Texas) and are more likely to live in large family groups. The unemployment rate increased from 3% to 15% from February to April 2020, and concerns over food insecurity, child support, and healthcare access continue to worsen. Thus, the authors suggest the following policy recommendations in order to better support these disadvantaged communities:
- Expand medicaid
- Eliminate immigration requirements for CHIP
- Pass registration banning ICE in healthcare
- Fund COVID-19 testing and treatment for uninsured

Based on their findings (illustrated below), the authors believe that using nanotechnology in point-of-care tools for blood clotting risk/severity assessment can assist physicians in making informed decisions on optimal treatment and management for this population.","J Proteome Res. 2020 Aug 31. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00425. Online ahead of print.","J Proteome Res","[""Saei AA"","" Sharifi S"","" Mahmoudi M.""]","The main observations of this review include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. The presence of the ACE2 receptor on the surface of the endothelial cells that line the blood and lymph vessel may be instrumental to SARS-CoV-2 induced blood clotting formation.

2. The authors believe that it is the interplay and imbalance between the complement system, inflammation, and the coagulation system influences thrombosis formation in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1).

3. Nanotechnology has been combined with proteomics techniques (mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics) to create plasma protein and biomarker detection both for disease identification and in deciphering disease mechanism. 

4. Theragnostic nanotechnologies have been used to diagnose thrombosis early and deliver thrombolytics/thrombosis inhibitors to the affected area by targeting biomarkers (P-selectin, D-dimer, and E-selectin molecules) in thrombi (Figure 1).

5. Nanotechnology has potential in the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in patients at high risk of blood clotting in determining appropriate treatment options.

6. Thrombosis treatment via nanomedicine involves delivering nanoparticles loaded with antithrombotic agents to the thrombus sites through one or several proteins involved in coagulation (e.g., fibrin, thrombin, or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the coagulation process (activated platelets, via cell-binding ligands).

7. Multiple other techniques involving the use of H2O2-responsive boronate antioxidant polymer (BAP), iron oxide nanoparticle micelles and liposome nanoparticles surface-modified with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) have been used with some success. (Table 2) 

8. Limitations to nanomedicine approaches have included: 
a. biomolecular/protein corona formation, which causes shielding of targeting species on the surface of nanoparticles and creates an additional barrier at the surface of drug-loaded nanocarriers
b. the inherent thrombogenicity of nanoparticles, such as TiO2 nanoparticles causing platelet aggregation and exacerbation of thrombosis risk 

9. Challenges with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics include: 
a. preservation of proteome coverage in larger sample cohorts 
b. the presence of highly abundant proteins such as albumin (55% of the total protein mass in plasma) which hinders comprehensive profiling of the plasma proteome and makes in-depth analysis of plasma cohorts challenging.

10. Though it can interfere with analysis, the presence of the biomolecular/protein corona can be utilised to mitigate the above limitations by detecting disease specific biomarkers via MS-based proteomics. 

11. Biomolecular/protein corona are unique from the biofluids in which they are submerged. The corona pattern (e.g., liposomes with various surface chemistries) acts as a “fingerprint” under the nanoparticle sensor can aid in rapid diagnosis of blood clotting and its severity. 

12. To further aid MS-based proteomic techniques, biofluids (serum, plasma) can be used:
a. to probe biomarkers in healthy versus patient samples
b. to develop nanoparticle-based assays that can adsorb proteins of interest on the surface of nanoparticles and make identifiable detection signals through color changes, electric signals etc.

13. Ezzat et al (2019) showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are covered by rich and unique biomolecular/ protein coronas in different biofluids. They suggest that the viral corona is a critical factor dictating virus−host interactions, affecting viral infectivity and induction of immunity through its interaction with biological markers.

14. Nanomedicine can help in selecting the best treatment strategy (e.g., appropriate dosing of blood-thinning medications) and in monitoring and drug adjustment (eg. aggressiveness of treatment to prevent the lethal consequences of massive blood clotting such as heart and/or brain strokes).

15. Analysis of the biomolecular/protein corona profiles of many nanoparticles (e.g., silica, polystyrene and gold) has shown that the corona has a role in absorption of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and/or coagulants, which can be extremely helpful for detection of sudden increases in the abundance of these proteins in blood plasma. 

16. Pre-coating nanoparticles with clot-related proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrin, factor VIII, factor XIII, tissue plasminogen activator or protein Z could aid the recruitment of similar proteins into the corona, leading to rapid identification of subtle signs of clotting in plasma.

17.	Well-developed colorimetric sensing platforms, including smartphone-readable systems for detection and discrimination of multiple proteins, may identify changes in the secretion of blood-clotting proteins by generating colored solutions detectable by the naked eye or point-of-care devices. For example, via the use of the protein corona in combination with the enzyme-mimetic activity of gold nanoparticles (i.e., polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane polymer-caged), a colorimetric analysis was developed to identify metallothioneins, which are important biomarkers for heavy-metal poisoning

18. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) which allows the binding of a protein to a molecule can change its thermal stability, thus utilizing protein stability and structural change as structural disease biomarkers.

The ethical justification for prioritizing younger patients is based on reducing disparities and offering children the equal opportunity of living a longer, complete life compared to older patients. The legal permissibility of using age is based on the Age Discrimination Act that permits giving children special priority unless this opportunity excludes others from consideration. When determining how to allocate life-saving treatment, some states have adopted using age as a 'tie-breaker' or factor for consideration with some portion of resources (such as ventilators) held in reserve for pediatric patients.

1. Trauma exposure inevitably means mental illness: Our world collectively demonstrates a strong resolve to overcome traumatic, life-altering events, as has been shown in the recent past with the World Trade Center attacks and previous SARS outbreak. Few individuals (&lt;10-15%) suffer from clinically significant post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms related to these events. Thus, history suggests we will develop a long-term resilience towards the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Resilient people do not have bad days or weeks: Resilience may vary greatly depending on the stressor. Each individual responds differently while coping from a stressful event, but importantly, everyone continues adapting.

3. Resilience is something you either have or you do not have: Resilience is actively shaped by behavioral, cognitive, and environmental processes. Resilience is developed most strongly by engaging in prosocial acts.

4. The risk to mental health from COVID-19 is a hoax: Individuals' mental health has been affected in the short-term. However, the community can actively meet the needs of those facing adversity at the advent of the pandemic. ",[],"Other","Opinion","[""Executive Summary""]"

Alternative diagnoses...are unlikely given the clinical context. Based on the MRI findings, including the slight olfactory bulb changes, we can speculate that SARS-CoV-2 might invade the brain through the olfactory pathway and cause an olfactory dysfunction of sensorineural origin; cerebrospinal fluid and pathology studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Ours and others’ observations of normal brain imaging in other patients with COVID-19–associated olfactory dysfunctions and the disappearance of the cortical MRI abnormalities in the follow-up study of this patient suggest that imaging changes are not always present in COVID-19 or might be limited to the very early phase of the infection.

 - The preservation of rural hospitals must be balanced with expectations that hospitals will reduce spending under a global budget model. 
 - The implementation of this payment model would require ""institutional infrastructure to support collaboration among state governments, payers, and rural hospitals."" 
 - Such models should be expected to produce long-term gains, and cannot be appropriately evaluated with short-term outcomes.

2. Steroids: oral steroids should be used when indicated, but risk should be weight against context; for example, spinal metastasis versus a relatively healthy patient who may not benefit greatly. Intra-articular steroid injections per usual are encouraged. 

3. Anticoagulants: the use heparin is advised instead of oral vitamin K antagonists due to the instability of that class of drugs in severe COVID-19 infections.

- Contextualize data within systems of power (social forces influence on social status) to allow for mapping of pathways through which gender roles, norms and relations are reinforced or disrupted during the pandemic.
- Support disaggregated surveillance, research, and programming through gender-based budgeting.
- Mainstream intersectionality through research design, program delivery, and evaluation
- Community participation (including lived experiences of women of oppressions/inequalities) to address needs of women and allow for tailoring/adaptation of evidence-based interventions.
- Utilize assets-based approach in programs and capitalize on existing community strengths/resources.
- Ensure educational access for females whose schooling may be challenged by concurrent domestic labor or caregiving responsibilities.

The review emphasizes the following:
- The diagnosis of AS carries with it a poor prognosis with 1-year mortality rates being as high as 40% in severe symptomatic cases and 21.1% within 3 years in asymptomatic cases. Postponing treatment is a high-risk decision.
- TAVI has grown increasingly popular in recent years and has emerged as a safe and effective alternative to SAVR.
- Early intervention has shown better patient outcomes since procedures become riskier with disease progression.
- When compared with SAVR, which is a more invasive technique with longer recovery time, TAVI has shown equal efficacy in intermediate-risk patients (Figure 1) and is even favorable to SAVR in low-risk patients (Figure 2).
- TAVI has low recovery time with no required ventilation or critical care in most cases, yielding reduced risk of COVID-19 exposure.
- Studies have shown good 5-year valve durability but data beyond 5 years is lacking. This may indicate increased risk in young, low-risk patients, as they will likely require repeat procedures beyond the initial 5-year period.
Overall, the authors recommend weighing risk of COVID-19 infection and potential procedural complications versus the chance of cardiac decompensation with postponement of a simplified TAVI procedure (Table 1) on a case-by-case basis.

- Type I and 2 myocardial infarctions secondary to COVID-19 infections may result in either the development of HF or the decompensation of pre-existing HF.
- 50% of patients who developed HF secondary to COVID-19 did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or hypertension.
- In resource-limited settings, younger patients and healthcare workers should be prioritized for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support.

Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with COVID-19:
- Continue use of ACEi/ARB/ARNI (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor/Angiotensin receptor blocker/Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor) therapy.
- Monitor for QT prolongation.
- Use anti-coagulation prophylactically and therapeutically for hospitalized patients.

Special Populations:
- More data is needed for adequate management of hypoxemic respiratory failure management in patients on LVAD support. 
- Immunocompromised transplant patients may present with atypical COVID-19 symptoms, and differentiation between viral myocardial infection and transplant rejection may be difficult.

Health Care Delivery:
- Telemedicine is recommended for consults, check-ins, and for provision of services if possible. 
- Recommend home measurement of blood pressure, weight, and blood oxygenation
- Utilize home COVID-19 testing as available.
- Reduce volume of non-emergent cardiac testing. 
- Increase use of palliative care and hospice.

Although beneficial for managing neurological disorders, these therapies are thought to be associated with an increased risk of viral infection due to the extensive depletion of immune cells. As a result, the authors urge practitioners and researchers to consider the risks and benefits, including the extent to which these immunotherapies may limit the antiviral host immunity.

The primary viremia: during a viral infection a small amount of virus can reach the bloodstream. As lymphatic vessels drain into the circulatory system, virus particles can freely reach the bloodstream via this way. Taking advantage from the disruption of the BBB caused by the inflammation or using ACE-2 receptors present at the surface of BBB endothelial cells, SARS-COV-2 could then enter the CSF (2a), without any proliferation within the brain parenchyma (3a). In this case symptoms would be limited to a meningeal syndrome. 1.b. The shortcut pathway from nasal cavity: When SARS-CoV-2 enters the nasal cavity it could reach the CNS via two routes. 2b_i: It could “passively” reach the CSF via the OECs that have an open connection with the CSF; the CNS immune response should prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain parenchyma (3a). 2b_ii: SARS-CoV-2 could also invade ORNs with the assumption that ACE-2 is present in those cells; in this case the virus would use a nerve pathway by being transported retrogradely from ORNs to the OB and could continue to spread through chains of connected neurons to reach the brain (3b), which might result in possible irreversible damage to the CNS. 1c. The secondary viremia: during a sustained viral replication due to the host inability to clear the viral proliferation a large amount of virus is produced and the respiratory epithelium can be disrupted, allowing the virus to reach the bloodstream. The virus could then cross the endothelial barrier by taking advantage from the disruption of the BBB caused by the inflammation or using ACE-2 receptors present at the surface of BBB endothelial cells (2c). The ineffective immune response leads to a viral proliferation within the brain parenchyma leading to neural cells damages and severe neurological symptoms (3c).""}]","4","Review / Literature Review",[]

One example offered in this article is the use of chloroquine based on in-vitro evidence. This may lead to QT prolongation for many patients as well as drug shortages for patients who use chloroquine for other illnesses.

Until trials prove a therapy or a vaccine effective, we should rely on public health interventions such as social distancing, disinfecting surfaces, and improved hand hygiene. Additionally, efforts should be made to assure that scientific journals are held to a high standard and are publishing the most clinically-relevant studies. ",[],"Other","Opinion",[]

Pathological signaling in the lung induced by particulate matter (PM) air pollution partially overlaps with that caused by severe SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, namely the release of proinflammatory interleukins (e.g., IL-6) from alveolar macrophages via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven activation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, lastly promoting an acceleration of thrombotic events. Patients already experiencing a chronic cytokine response might be at higher risk of COVID-19 lethal complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bottom. Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflammation in human aging, therapeutic interventions capable of targeting mitochondrial electron transport and prevent mitochondrial ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release (e.g., metformin) might illuminate a preventive/prophylactic mechanism of action to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people.

1. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs; i.e. polymerase chain reaction [PCR])
• Benefits: high levels of accuracy and sensitivity
• Limitations: considerably longer sample-to-results time (i.e. from 4 hours to a few days)
2. Rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs):
• Benefits: rapid POC diagnosis and ability for large scale testing
• Limitations: poor positive predictive value (PPV) and very limited sensitivity, especially for adults
3. Lateral flow assays (LFAs): 
• Benefits: inexpensive and rapid POC testing
• Limitations: only provide qualitative information (i.e. presence or absence of antibodies), and lack sensitivity and reproducibility.
4. Optical biosensors: viral diagnosis (Table 1), respiratory virus diagnosis (Table 2), and genomic assay (Figure 3)
• Benefits: excellent sensitivity, robustness, quantitative measure, and immunity to electromagnetic interferences, while also allowing for rapid POC diagnosis. Possess potential to combine rapid viral genomic analysis, serology assays, and direct virus detection/identification in one integrated platform.

Online ahead of print.","Methods","[""Haddad C"","" Davila-Calderon J"","" Tolbert BS.""]","Summary of experimental techniques as follows:

ScanFold: single-sequence computational method used to identify RNA structural motifs, helpful for studying RNA sequences with poor sequence alignment
- Identification of evolutionarily conserved functional regions can be identified using ScanFold with complementary sequence alignment data.
- ScanFold is limited in that predicted structures must be experimentally validated.

DMS-MaP seq: probes RNA secondary structure in vivo and in vitro
- As a reliable method to generate quantitative analysis of RNA secondary structures in vivo, DMS-Map seq has the advantage of providing insights into viral RNA structures under physiological conditions.
- DMS-Map seq is limited in that only the exposed A and C bases are modified, therefore obtained information is most reliable for determining which bases are not involved in stable Watson-Crick base pairs.

Antisense probing: studies effects of environmental factors on the accessibility of RNA structure
- Useful in understanding translation of viral proteins after cellular entry, replication pathways, RNA accessible regions and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in coronaviruses.
-  A limitation of antisense RNA probing is that it requires theoretical knowledge on RBPs to efficiently study these interactions.

CLIP-seq: identifies RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites on RNA to better understand host-virus interactions
- It is useful to pair CLIP-seq with other structural approaches to provide detailed RNA physiochemical mechanisms.
- CLIP-seq is limited by its inability to obtain information on the surrounding RNA structural environment, which weakens interpretations of the influence of RNA-RNA interactions on RNA-protein binding.

NMR spectroscopy: produces high-resolution three-dimensional RNA to study structure and conformational dynamics
- Reconstructing RNA functional structures via NMR is helpful in understanding viral pathogenesis. Titration experiments can also be used to map binding sites and post-binding dynamics along an RNA surface.
- NMR is obviously limited due to restriction of studying molecular systems less than ∼50 kDa and in buffer conditions that approximate the cellular environment.

Those who screen positive for COVID-19 risk factors can delay in-person appointments provided their dysphagia is not urgent or life-threatening.
2. Barium esophagram doesn't require close contact, so it can be used safely when evaluating patients for esophageal dysmotility. 
3. Radiographic imaging can be used safely for patients who may have malignancy. 
4. When a diagnostic procedure is required to evaluate oropharyngeal dysphagia, the authors recommend modified barium swallowing study (MBSS) over fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) as MBSS is less likely to disperse aerosol particles. When performing any aerosol generating procedure, they recommend use or proper PPE and air filters in the procedure suite remove aerosol particles.

Thus, there is great interest in studying the potential benefits of anti-inflammatory nutrition during pregnancy to avoid the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Dietary intake of sulforaphane and its precursor, glucoraphanin, may reduce the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring due to their anti-inflammatory effects.

On examination, O2sat: 88% on ambient air, pulse: 65/min, BP: 132/82 mmHg, RR: 17 breaths/min. Since he did not meet the SARS-CoV-2 criteria by ECDC, he was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. On day 5, he was transferred to ICU due to acute respiratory failure and subsequently developed multi-organ failure with ARDS. On day 7, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with remdesivir. CT scan on day 10 showed bilateral pleuro-pneumopathy with pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities. Interferon β-1a was administered on day 23 and the patient died the next day (Figure 1).

They quantified 72 serum analytes of this patient compared to 5 healthy donors (HD) and 5 septic shock (SS) patients, and found alterations in immune responses as follows (Figures 2 ,3):

GlcNAc can be sulfated at three distinct sites (-6S, -NS, and -3S) and IdoA at one (-2S). Unfractionated heparin is composed of HS chains that are greater than 30 saccharides in length whereas low molecular weight heparin constituent HS chains are 22 saccharides or less (3). The charge distribution of heparin imparted by the presence of the precise pentasaccharide sequence shown allows for the binding of heparin to serine protease inhibitor antithrombin-III (AT3), conferring its primary anticoagulant effect. Innumerable other sulfation sequences are found in heparin preparations, which leads to binding and biologically relevant activity modulation of many other proteins.

The hospital cancelled all visiting hours and restricted family and friends' access to the hospital. Urgent questions regarding pregnancy were fielded via teleconference. A triage system based on COVID-19 risk of exposure was implemented.
2. Staff governance: Staffing was minimized to reduce the number of providers at risk of infection. Fewer duties were assigned to residents.
3. Residency programs: To avoid gathering, morning report was cancelled and messaging applications were leveraged to communicate among residents.

- Data to support the duration of immunity and provide evidence for any expiration date need to be available
- Antibody testing should comply with an international quality standard, be easily accessible, and have high performance characteristics
- Immunity passports should be highly resistant to fraud and have the capability to display exemption from certain requirements, such as wearing a face mask in public

The authors note that current evidence is encouraging but still lacks support for many of these considerations, which are unlikely to be resolved soon.

However, there are no specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 induced AKI and the authors conclude early detection of AKI and use of established renal therapies is the best strategy to improve patients' outcome. 
-Epidemiology in Wuhan China reports an average incidence for AKI is 11% overall and 23% for critically ill patients (Figure 1).
-Pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI include direct renal injury, increased RAAS activation, and elevation of inflammatory cytokines (Figure 3). 
-Proteinuria, hematuria and increased kaliuresis on urinalysis with SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with higher mortality rates and admission to the ICU. 
-SARS-CoV-2 can gain entry to kidney cells via attachment to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which may also lead to imbalanced RAAS (Figure 4).

Findings of analysis as follows:
- Articles (gathered from PubMed) identified coronavirus study-specific human genes (CSHG) and coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) and the relative position of any CSHG to a specific CSSE (Table 1).
- Authors found coronavirus binding to ACE2 alters homeostasis of RAS pathway due to functional changes in ACE2/angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, leading to increased action of angiotensin II on angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and increased expression of IL-6 and IP-10 thereby triggering cytokine storm and causing acute lung injury (Figure 7).
- Z scores for numerical blood indices including functional markers of the liver, kidney, and heart were analyzed in 6 groups (ARB, non-ARB, patients without medical history, mild illness, severe illness, and critical illness), which showed a relationship between the non-ARB group and severe illness (Table 5).
- Out of 31 hypertensive patients analyzed, the ARB group (n=8) developed less severe illness compared to the non-ARB group.

Although the data is limited by the small n, the authors suggest ARBs may reduce COVID-19 severity and benefit COVID-19 patients with acute lung injury.

1. Polymorphisms may exist for ACE and ACE2 genes that lead to less severe symptoms from COVID-19.
2. Increased levels of ACE2 mRNA and reduced levels of TMPRSS2 (a serine protease involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry) mRNA were observed in CF airway epithelial cells compared to non-CF cells.
3. High levels of ACE2 in CF patients may promote production of anti-inflammatory angiotensin 1-7 (Figure 1A) while lower levels of TMPRSS2 may prevent SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, leading to overall reduced inflammation and lung injury.
4. Azithromycin and serine protease inhibitor treatment in patients with CF could contribute to milder COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 1B). 
5. A CF lung has high levels of serine protease inhibitors (such as ecotin and SERPINB1), which may prevent TMPRSS2 from promoting SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3OexjUvfgnt5aa0"",""description"":""Figure 1A: Role of ACE, ACE II, TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 lung infection.

Interferons are immune molecules that trigger an immediate and intense local response when a virus invades a cell, by triggering proteins to attack the virus as well as signal additional immune cells to respond to the infection. Although interferons can be powerful at fighting viral infection, if given too late they can lead to a harmful cascade of inflammation, which is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this theorized treatment is time sensitive. The Stanford trial, which is one of dozens of interferon trials currently ongoing within the U.S, consists of 16 patients newly infected with COVID-19 who were given either a placebo or type III interferon. One of the patients currently in the Stanford trial is 52-year-old Valerie McCarthy (Figure 1) who tested positive for COVID-19 on April 30th.

After adapting the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model to include a cardiac portion, they simulated the daily hospital resource utilization of COVID-19 patients as well as utilization of resources for cardiovascular procedures such as coronary bypass grafting which typically have a poor outcome when left untreated. Their work covers three phases of the pandemic:
-Phase 1: The initial “crisis” phase modelled the worst-case scenario which led to the immediate cessation of all elective outpatient cardiac procedures and surgeries
-Phase 2: The epidemiology pattern showed Ontario would not reach the worse-case scenario, and the model was adjusted to take this into account. This led to a change in policy, allowing scheduled outpatient cardiac procedures for those at highest risk of mortality to resume, based in local resources
-Phase 3: The “recovery” phase, is on-going and taking into account real-world data, with the recognition that multiple waves of the pandemic may occur
The authors conclude that decision analytic modeling tools must take into account rapidly evolving data so that policy can be updated and changed to ensure no resources are wasted.

Aerosol-level PPE may be incompatible with rotary flight PPE, and alternatives may be necessary. No specific recommendations are made on the level of PPE appropriate for patient transfer. 
- Reducing exposure to people: At the pilot’s discretion, crew members may be omitted from flights to reduce the number of personnel involved. 
- Reducing exposure to equipment: Contact with equipment should be minimized to limit contamination and avoid extensive decontamination measures.

Key decisions: at the referring hospital
- Route: Minimize cross-contamination by coordinating with the hospital on arrival time, transit in the hospital, and use of hospital PPE.
- Intubation: Reduce the risk of potential aerosolization of particles, and minimize the number of personnel and PPE required. 
- Packaging: Reduce patients’ infectivity potential by disinfecting as needed.
- Ground handling: Minimize the staff responsible for handling the patient. Transport patients to the intensive care units immediately from the helipad as necessary.

Key decisions: in flight
- Non-intubated patients: Ask patients to assist in disinfecting their hands to minimize surface contamination.
- Intubated patients: Ensure patients are under appropriate sedation and muscle relaxation to prevent coughing. Maintain airway connections.

Key decisions: at mission control
- Waste disposal planning: Appropriately sort contaminated waste from non-contaminated waste. Safely doff contaminated PPE.
- Decontamination: Clean and disinfect surfaces immediately. Decontaminate the cabin before doffing PPE. Cleaning procedures may vary.

Key decisions: in the community
- Accidental exposure: HEMS crews should practice social isolation and appropriate hygienic practices. Keep an accurate log of those with COVID-19 exposure.
- Base living: Manage the risk of cross-infection amongst teams operating from the same base.

They report that a majority of potential COVID-19 vaccines are intended to induce antibody responses that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (virus-neutralizing antibodies [NAbs] directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike [S] protein), and the American “Warp Speed” program had been narrowed down to five front-line candidates that are based on mRNA or adenovirus and other viral vectors. Authors suggest that aggressive timelines due to urgency of need, adequate vaccine trials, along with manufacturing and distribution scale are among the greatest challenges faced in vaccine development, which calls for global cooperation between researchers.","J Virol. 2020 Jun 26:JVI.01083-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01083-20. Online ahead of print.","J Virol","[""Moore JP"","" Klasse PJ.""]","Summary of additional review findings below:
- General concerns in vaccine development: Studies showed that immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines may enhance infection or exacerbate disease in individuals who become infected despite vaccination, which could result in public backlash against vaccines. Time lost during a spreading pandemic is another fundamental concern.
- Antibody responses in COVID-19 cases vary greatly during the clinical course: Extreme variation in antibody titers holds true across multiple cohort studies and may reflect pathological consequences of infection or be a result of samples collected too early in the disease course before their peak. Additionally, identifying what titers protect against disease in COVID-19 cohorts is difficult.
- Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein: Strong sequence similarities among antibodies from different donors has useful implications for the response to S-protein vaccines on a population basis. The similarity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) epitopes for these nMAbs and their very limited maturation from germline sequences are encouraging indicators that potent polyclonal neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) will be triggered by S-protein or RBD vaccines.
-Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates: Most industry-based vaccine programs fell into one of three general categories including nucleic-acid (mRNA or DNA) plasmids, replicating virus vectors (adenovirus or vaccinia virus) and recombinant S-proteins or the RBD. Collective needs are creating unusually aggressive timelines for a product that can be used widely in humans. Data suggests most rapidly produced vaccines (i.e. nucleic acids and virus vectors) may also be the least capable of eliciting high titers of antibodies and NAbs to the S-protein (Figure 2).
-Vaccine challenge experiments in monkey models: A chimpanzee adenovirus construct (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine was not a strong inducer of antibody responses to the S-protein in macaque animal models, which appeared true of DNA plasmids as well (Figure 2). Few macaques were completely protected from infection but a reduction in the severity of the already mild disease was noted. 
- Protective antibody titer for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and length of persistence: Magnitude of antibody response to protect humans from SARS-CoV-2 infection and how long any protective response might last both remain unknown. Induction of B-cell memory responses to protect from disease may be more feasible, though booster immunizations could be necessary.
- Vaccine-mediated adverse events: Creating herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may require a vaccine efficacy rate of ~70%. Vaccinating during a pandemic could involve induction of weak and potentially deleterious priming responses in people who then encounter the virus before they receive their boosting immunizations, but given the unusual circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic there is limited time for critical analysis of adverse events.
- Outcome scenarios: Favorably, efficacy trials will show that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines confer robust protection that will bring a prompt end to the pandemic. While feasible, it is not certain that vaccines rapidly manufactured in large volume (e.g., mRNA, DNA, adenovirus vectors) will be sufficiently immunogenic to elicit protective NAb responses in a high proportion of the population. Unfavorably, the first vaccines tested are not immunogenic enough to be protective but are not associated with significant adverse events before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

How the various categories are summarized in this table is based on the small amount of available data, combined with general experience of how similarly designed vaccines have performed against other viral pathogens. Nonetheless, there are considerable uncertainties behind some of the assessments in the table. Emerging clinical trial data will determine whether they are accurate.\n2) Safety indicates the likelihood the vaccine will be tolerated without serious adverse effects in the absence of infection. For all categories, there are substantial uncertainties about the risk of exacerbated pathogenesis post-infection, by ADE and VAERD mechanisms (see text). These risks may be the greatest for vaccines that induce only low NAb titers, and/or a high non2054 NAb/NAb ratio.\n3) Most emphasis has been placed on the induction of NAbs, although some data on cellular immune responses are emerging from animal studies and more will be obtained in human trials. Attempts to induce cytotoxic T-cells might include immunization with viral proteins other than S, including non-surface exposed internal ones (e.g., the N-protein). Extrapolation from other vaccines leads to the assessments listed.\n4) N/A, not applicable. There are no known plans to produce this type of vaccine.\n5) For a killed virus vaccine to be safe, the pathogen must be fully inactivated. Historically, inactivation has sometimes been incomplete (e.g., with polio vaccines).\n6)Delivering DNA vaccines into muscles via electroporation is a relatively complex procedure\ncompared to direct injection via needles or oral delivery.\n7) The ease with which mRNA vaccines can be formulated and distributed has not been widely discussed. However, if these vaccines turn out to be unstable at ambient temperatures it will be challenging to distribute frozen or chilled stocks.\n8) General experience suggests that producing a stable cell line and using it to make large stocks of recombinant proteins under Good Manufacturing Process conditions can take 1-2 years.""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_1eypQt7PTlcKZag"",""description"":""Figure 2: Magnitudes of S-protein binding antibody (ELISA) and NAb responses in COVID-19 cases and vaccinated humans and animals.\nA, B, C) Anti-S protein (open symbols) and anti-RBD (closed symbols) endpoint titers; D, E, F) NAb midpoint titers (ID50) from PV assays (open symbols) and RV assays (closed symbols).

They identified a subset of populations that are particularly vulnerable including people with existing mental or intellectual disability, COVID-19 survivors, healthcare workers, pregnant or postpartum individuals, and other socioeconomic determinant factors. They describe these patient populations and their health needs as four waves (Figure 1):
- First wave consists of patients who are COVID-19 positive. 
- Second wave consists of individuals with acute healthcare needs such as myocardial infarction or first episodes of psychosis occurring during the pandemic who did not seek medical attention secondary to fear of COVID-19. 
- Third wave involves people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and schizophrenia, who generally require regular follow-up but have been unable to receive adequate care due to the pandemic. 
- Fourth wave consists of all individuals who will suffer from mental health issues as a result of COVID-19.

- Organizational reconstruction was recommended by establishing a multidisciplinary designated team to create an incident management system (IMS) for COVID-19 and organizing hospital emergency response plans (Figure 1).
- Optimizing the use of key equipment used for droplet, contact, or airborne precautions should be prioritized. Reuse and/or extending the use of PPE was also recommended (Table 1).

Suspecting and Diagnosing a COVID-19 Case
- COVID-19 should be suspected based on signs and symptoms. Signs include but are not limited to: contact with patients with COVID-19 or travel to epidemic areas. Symptoms vary but include fever, cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, and shortness of breath, and some patients also show myalgia, sore throat, and headache.
- Viral testing with RT-PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2 is recommended, although other laboratory and imaging findings such as a chest x-ray or chest CT can provide support for the diagnosis.

Initial Management of COVID-19
- Stratifying designated teams who will care for patients with COVID-19 should be based on disease severity.
- Adult COVID-19 patients should be started on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula when the peripheral oxygen saturation is &lt;92%. High-flow nasal cannula is recommended since it has been shown to lead to decreased intubation, although there is a risk of HCW transmission.
- There are limited studies regarding the best hemodynamic support for patients but immediate resuscitation by crystalloids or norepinephrine is recommended.
- Only remdesivir and dexamethasone have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19, although it should be selected carefully in discussion with other providers.

Dealing with the Aftermath
- Contact tracing immediately or within 24 hours is recommended following a detection of a confirmed COVID-19 case. The degree of exposure needs to be assessed as well (Table 2).
- Surgical masks and proper hand hygiene is recommended for HCWs to prevent nosocomial infection of COVID-19.
- Quarantine is recommended following contact tracing and is effective in preventing the generation of new clusters of patients with COVID-19. Medical surveillance for at least 14 days from the last contact is recommended.
- An ongoing COVID-19 outbreak brings both physical and psychological stress to HCWs so providing strategies to deal with these such as counseling are recommended.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_VIIdW6lvR3oS29b"",""description"":""Figure. 1.

1. Respirator masks (N95/FFP2), while 95% efficient in filtering particles of 0.3 microns, are single use only. The tight fit and high filtering efficiency might induce shortness of breath and discomfort, and are thus recommended for healthcare providers only.
2.  Surgical masks, classified by levels/types 1–3 corresponding to increasing filtration capacity, are looser fitting and not recommended for particulate filtration. Nonetheless, use is routine in healthcare settings, with type 3 filtration efficiency at 98% for particles greater than 0.3 microns.
3. In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), a 96.6% compliance rate of mask-wearing correlated with a decreased SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate when compared to other cities in China over the study period.
4. Single use and cloth masks are not generally regarded as efficient filters of particulate matter; nonetheless, they are recommended in community settings. 
5. Disinfection with heat in moist conditions reduced numbers of M2 bacteriophage and Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) on deconstructed masks in test conditions without compromising the integrity of the filter; radiation and chemical means damaged filters and/or left potentially toxic residue.
6. Reusability has been poorly characterized for most masks, though N95 masks might be suitable for reuse up to 60 washes. 
7. Face shields are still recommended for aerosol-generating procedures.
8. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are highly efficient filters, though the associated high cost and required training for proper use limit their use to healthcare settings when fit tests for other masks are failed.
9. The bridge of the nose is a particular area of damage with prolonged use of tight-fitting masks. Masks may also cause allergic reactions with prolonged use.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_248AkjggKVejmDj"",""description"":""Table 1.

Although cotton masks have only one-third the efficacy of surgical masks, they will still reduce droplet/particle transmission, making them adequate for persons without respiratory symptoms to wear in public as communities begin to reopen and allowing for better allocation of medical grade masks.","J Korean Med Sci. 2020 May 25;35(20):e186. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e186.","J Korean Med Sci","[""Kim MN.""]","During the COVID-19 pandemic, as there continues to be no current curative treatment or vaccine, the most important way to control the spread of infection is through hand hygiene, environmental control, quarantine, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Proper hygiene should continue to be strictly observed during this pandemic, as most respiratory viruses are transmitted more commonly through contact rather than droplets. However, SARS-CoV-2 poses a unique challenge as it is highly infectious, and many people show little to no symptoms making it difficult to know when to self-isolate. Due to this, new policies have been implemented for mandatory masks in public areas as more communities start to reopen, however long-term use of medical grade masks by the public is not practical. Adequate medical grade PPE, specifically high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) masks (such as KF94 or N95) and surgical masks, have been a sparse resource for those who need it most, partially due to being overused by the general public. Comparison of a KF94 verses a surgical mask after droplet inoculation is depicted in Figure 1. The applications and features of numerous types of masks, including surgical masks, HEPA masks, and cotton masks, are outlined in Table 1. Although both surgical masks and HEPA masks provide better control of droplet transmission, given scarce resource allocation, especially when considering long-term logistics of this pandemic, cotton masks have been shown to prevent some droplet and particle transmission and therefore maybe worn as a last resort for those who are not displaying respiratory symptoms.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3HA1qS1u8Ql7yde"",""description"":""""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_2scko4SZmE9DLNE"",""description"":""""}]","Other",,

- Prognosis of patients with COVID-19 discharged from the emergency department (ED) using POCUS characterization: POCUS may better characterize portable chest radiography findings of potentially discharged patients by the presence of subpleural effusions or consolidations, the degree of B-lines, and alveolar consolidations. POCUS may also reveal findings associated with a higher degree of clinical decompensation that would require admission.

- Prognosis of admitted patients with serial POCUS to identify pulmonary and/or cardiac complications: POCUS may help to transition patient care in COVID-19 cases from reactive to proactive by predicting common pulmonary or cardiac complications prior to current assessments and provide a better prognostic tool for clinicians. 

- Development and management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with serial POCUS: Serial POCUS to identify patients at risk for decompensation based on alveolar consolidation, increased involvement, and B-lines for more appropriate interventions. Use of POCUS-guided alveolar recruitment strategies may also assess breathing and readiness for extubation and should be compared to current use of prone positioning in patients with severe acute respiratory distress.

- Monitoring development of cardiac injury with serial use of POCUS: Cardiac complications common in critically ill patients include viral myocarditis, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusions, and right ventricular dysfunction for those positive for COVID-19. POCUS may help to detect these complications prior to clinical deterioration

- Characterizing the L and H subtypes of COVID-19 with lung POCUS and better differentiate the phenotypes: Serial lung POCUS can help characterize pulmonary edema and alveolar consolidation indicative of a high elastance or low compliance which is more commonly seen in type H compared to type L.

- Governments at all levels should work with internet providers to provide free and accessible internet access to address disparities in information, education, healthcare, and connectedness.
- Occupation and public health departments should implement standardized and frequent inspections of open business to enforce COVID-19 safety policies.
- Employees should be protected in the case of COVID-19 sick leave or if they need to take time off to care for a sick family member.
- Government and healthcare system coordination should work to protect insurance coverage of COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment interventions, including preventive health and the treatment of underlying conditions.
- Hospital leadership must identify and address any biases in treatment algorithms for COVID-19, such as ventilator use.

Intermediate- and long-term policy recommendations:
- Policymakers should prioritize development of affordable, culturally sensitive, multilingual, and accessible health-related outreach education.
- Policymakers should restore funding and/or the equivalent of expected patient reimbursements to community health systems.
- Policymakers should increase funding for developing innovative, accessible, and culturally sensitive healthcare delivery options, such as mobile clinics.",[],"Other","Guidelines and Recommendations",[]

- Hygiene: Women tend to practice hygienic measures such as hand-washing more frequently than men, predisposing them to lesser infection rates.
- Smoking/Comorbidities: More men have smoking habits (50% vs 9%) and are active smokers (35% vs 22%) than women. Obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are generally higher in men and lead to more severe disease.

- Hormones: It is postulated that estrogen activates immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, natural-killer cells) leading to immunity against infections.

- The Rapid Response Team was mobilized to study these patients' medical records, interview the patients to determine their recent activities and contacts, and scrutinize their cell phone and credit card data. Any enclosed space that the patient previously occupied was closed for cleaning and opened a day later. Identified contacts were told to self-isolate for 14 days and keep track of their symptoms.  
- The province designated Masan Medical Center (MMC) for mild to moderate COVID-19 cases and four university hospitals for severe cases. Patients were released when they had no more symptoms and tested negative twice. The Patient Management Team determined which hospital a patient should be admitted to and when a patient should be released, and they used an instant messenger service to discuss patient information. MMC's policies: healthcare workers donned PPE in a designated place, enter the room through a predetermined route, and leave after a shower; 1 room per patient or 2 patients in a room if the patients could stay at least 6 feet away from each other; portable chest radiography for patients on the day of admission and additional blood tests for those with pneumonia, fever, or co-morbidity; treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir.
- Average age of patients was 41.3 +/- 19 years. Most common co-morbidities were hypertension (18.9%), diabetes (7.2%), and tumors (3.6%). Average incubation time was 6.5 +/- 4.3 days. Common first symptoms were cough (30%), muscle ache (26.1%), fever (25.2%), loss of taste and smell (15.7% and 14.7%). 25 patients had no symptoms at the time of admission, and 18 of these patients developed symptoms after a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.9 days. 44.1% of the patients developed pneumonia, at an average of 7 days after first symptoms. Low lymphocyte count in 52.2%, low platelet count in 7.5%, and low leukocyte count in 25.4% of patients. Average period of disease detection was 24 +/- 10.8 days after first symptoms.

1. Both upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract samples should be collected, in the same universal transport medium (UTM). If only one sample can be accessed, nasopharyngeal sample is preferred.
2. Available flocked swabs in Korea can be seen in Figure 1.
3. For sputum samples, it is recommended that 500ul sputum is mixed in a 1:1 ratio with PBS or UTM and glass beads. After sufficient vortexing and centrifugation, supernatant can be used for nucleic acid extraction.
4. When validating extraction methods, the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit should be used as a gold standard.
5. The six approved RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 diagnosis can be found in Table 2.
6. ""To change or add EUA [emergency use authorization] assays, parallel tests using at least 10 positive and 10 negative samples should be performed, and the results should be reviewed by the person in charge of the laboratory.""
7. For assays that involve an internal, positive control in each sample, if internal control is not detected, retesting is recommended. If a there is not enough sample for re-extraction, a 10-fold dilution of the RNA can be used.
8. Increasing input RNA for increased testing sensitivity is not recommended.
9. If upper and lower respiratory tract samples reveal conflicting results, tests can be considered positive, as long as positive testing criteria are met.
10. For newly diagnosed patients, E-positive/RdRp-negative test results should be re-run for the possibility of contamination.
11. Amplification signal in the negative control may be due to workspace contamination, nonspecific amplification, or probe instability.
12. Manufacturer-provided Ct values should be used with caution.
13. Follow-up testing should be reported as ""positive"" if all tested genes are detectable, ""indeterminate"" if more than one but not all genes are detectable, and ""negative"" only if all clinical symptoms are gone and there have been two consecutive tests with no detectable genes.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3kH4OM41eYbKbyj"",""description"":""Figure 1.

- Risks are heightened due to the risk of contracting SARS-CoV2, especially in immunocompromised populations or alter the ability of a person to fight off infection, so risk mitigation strategies need to be in place to resume clinical trials.

The authors hypothesize that increased adipose tissue, which is known to produce angiotensinogen, also increases Ang II and, thus, contributes to renin-angiotensin-system dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2). Based on this hypothesis, they suggest ACE inhibitors, ARBs, Mas receptor agonists (antagonists of angiotensin I), and recombinant ACE2 may benefit patients with COVID-19; particularly those with obesity or metabolic disease.

-In 788 confirmed COVID-19 cases, there was a severe/critical rate of 9.9% with a median 11 day positive nuclear acid testing. This was a decreased rate of severe/critical cases and prolonged positive period compared to cases in Wuhan, China.
-A SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from a patient with mild COVID-19 and 24 day duration of positive testing (ZJ01) was found to have 35 unique genetic mutations, possibly illustrating a potential evolutionary branch of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 10 mutations were located on the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2.
-54 viral strains were classified in a novel C/T categorization system (Figure 3C) that could be used to trace route of infection and viral evolution.
-Mutations nears the furin cleavage site (FCS) region in ZJ01 changed the protein structure conformation and surface electrostatic potential, influencing the binding capacity with furin, a protease in host cells that is involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, suggesting that FCSs may be an important site of evolution.
-Single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung, liver, and colon cells illustrated that ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 expression was the same, although TMPRSS2 was expressed at higher levels. Furin was expressed in all cell types of the three tissues with little ACE-2 co-expression, suggesting that furin and other proteases may play an important role in increasing viral ability to enter host cells.
-These results shed some light on the potential for SARS-CoV-2 evolution, as seen with the mild ZJ01 strain, which could influence disease severity and progression.

The authors suggest this can be done by aligning anti-inflammatory medication dosing with the immune system's natural circadian rhythm. The body experiences peak release of detrimental inflammatory mediators between the hours of 1600 and 2400 (see Figure 1).

From their analyses, the researchers found the following:

-The top 10 metropolitan areas contained 61% of confirmed cases in the US
-Metropolitan areas had a higher incidence and mortality than non-metropolitan areas (Figure 1)
-Within metropolitan areas themselves, urban areas were more affected than suburban or rural areas (Figure 2). 
Although this was the general trend, there were some smaller non-metropolitan counties that had relatively high incidence and mortality rates. The authors mapped the county data to give a better idea of the distribution (Figures 3). In relation to incidence, the population density was the strongest predictor, with percent of the population over 65 and testing rates also being significant.

Studies reported the following host genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-1:
- No association with ACE2 gene polymorphisms (Chiu et al).
- Protective role of CLEC4M tandem repeats (Chan et al).
- Link between SARS and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency (Ip et al).
- HLA-1 polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility.

Host genetic factors associated with MERS were identified, including: ""the virus entry receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4]), presumed attachment factors, sialic acids, host proteases (i.e. TMPRSS2, furin, cathepsins), interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and adaptive immune response factors.""

Host genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1):
- ACE2 variant (N720D) proximal to TMPRSS2 cleavage site was potentially associated with COVID-19 susceptibility (Renieri et al).
- Levels of expression of ACE2 was correlated with disease severity (Pinto et al).
- SNP associated with TMPRSS2 may cause increased susceptibility due to increased TMPRSS2 (Russo et al).
- Various HLA loci may predict susceptibility.
- Increased inflammatory factors and IL-6 were associated with increased severity of disease.

Current evidence suggests human genetic variations may affect COVID-19 susceptibility, but the variants and their role remain unknown. The authors acknowledge a need for large scale host genetic studies to determine roles of genes, better understand immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for vaccine development, and gain information regarding disease pathogenesis and treatments.

Individuals in the population harbor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a variety of genes (eg, ACE2, TMPRSS2, HLA, CD147, MIF, IFNG, IL6) that have been implicated in the pathology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. These and other genetic variants may modulate disease susceptibility, increase or decrease disease severity, alter the variety of symptoms developed, and affect the magnitude and/or quality of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In addition to host genetic variation, genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 (and other pathogenic coronaviruses) can exhibit differences in biological activity. Single amino acid mutations in the spike glycoprotein can modulate ACE2 binding or alter B cell epitopes to promote immune escape or render monoclonal antibodies ineffective, while mutations in non-structural/accessory proteins can promote the development of resistance to antivirals, alter T cell epitopes, disrupt cell mediated immunity, and modulate host cellular interactions with viral particles""}]","Other","Review / Literature Review",[]

Finally, they suggest a method for predicting severity of disease, primarily by a neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; a more severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 would have an increased ratio.

These effects resulted in neutralization of the virus, observed through reduced inflammation and viral burden in mice as well as a protective effect in rhesus monkeys after exposure to these monoclonal antibodies.

1. Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Several dosing regimens have been used, however, the FDA has recommended 800 mg on day 1 followed by 400 mg daily for 4-7 days. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended to be used in conjunction with azithromycin or zinc supplementation. Risk of QT prolongation and heart arrhythmia at high cumulative dosages.
2. Lopinavir/ritonavir: The main combination treatment used in Korea and was found to significantly reduce viral load. Current treatment with this drug is for 14 days at a dosage of 10/2.5 mg/kg respectively. There is a high risk of GI adverse events. 
3. Remdesivir: Given as a 200 mg dose on the first day and then 100 mg for the following 5-10 days. Remdesivir has shown activity against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical trials. Daily monitoring of liver and renal functions should be done, if possible. 
4. Tocilizumab: Current evidence from a retrospective study (n=21) demonstrated possible decrease in mortality. Current dosages are 8 mg/kg every 12 hours or a single 200 mg IV dose. Providers should monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Additionally, severe liver damage and intestinal perforation are potential risks requiring monitoring.
5. Ciclesonide: An inhaled steroid currently being tested for treatment with COVID-19 patients at a dosage of 320 mcg every 12 hours for 14 days.
6. Niclosamide: Originally used as an anthelmintic drug, it is being considered as a possible treatment via a single 2 gram dose. 
7. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG):  Recommended dosage is 0.2-0.5 g/kg/day, likely to be used only in critically ill patients. ",[],"Other","Guidelines and Recommendations","[""Executive Summary""]"

Their model also reveals that ending severe preventive measures in a community is associated with a strong second wave of cases, while ending less severe preventive measures is not associated with a strong second wave of cases (albeit with greater initial peak incidences; Figure 1, 2). These findings suggest that population heterogeneity does influence herd immunity levels, especially when comparing to the herd immunity level (60%) based on a homogenous population model.

Each stratification was designated its own coefficient in the model.  The model also assumed that infected individuals remained latent for 3 days and infectious for 4 days.  The severity of preventive measures was denoted by the character alpha; the model assumes the alpha coefficient is less than 1 during preventive measures and alpha = 1 after the preventive measures have ceased. The model implements first incidence at day 0, preventive measures implemented at day 30, and preventive measures retracted at day 135.  The findings show that severe preventive measures does decrease initial peak incidence of COVID-19, but also results in a second wave of cases even greater than the first after preventive measures have been retracted.  However, cumulative cases of severe preventive measures are greater than moderate preventive measures but fewer than light preventive measures.  While no preventive measures does indeed achieve herd immunity, the initial peak of cases is much greater than the light, moderate, and severe preventive measures.  Furthermore, cumulative cases of zero preventive measures were found to be greater than cumulative cases in all other groups. The researchers noted that their model’s parameters does not adequately consider the sheer heterogeneity of human interaction and susceptibility, and recommend using the model as a guideline rather than an epidemiological plan.

- Coronaviridae are classified as single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome-bearing viruses. 
- Notable coronavirus strains of include SARS-CoV (with 8000 cases and 774 deaths worldwide), MERS-CoV (considered the most lethal), and the current SARS-CoV-2 strain (which has affected 214 countries and territories as of April 2020). 
- Although the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to prior strains, it is significantly more infectious in transmission, with a high likelihood of asymptomatic transmission and an basic reproduction number (R0) likely between 2.2 to 3.22. 
- RT-PCR has arisen as the most common form of testing, but clinicians are still navigating potential false negative and false positive results. 
- There is no current cure or vaccine for this infection, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported four drugs as potential candidates: remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta-1a, and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Governments have also created more lenient regulations regarding possible vaccine candidates as well.",[],"Other",,

- Most motility and function tests can be postponed and only need to be considered in the late recovery phases of the pandemic EXCEPT in the presence of dysphagia associated with aspiration or intractable vomiting with electrolyte imbalances or weight loss.
- Upper GI function tests that involve the positioning of a catheter through the nasopharynx are considered high risk given the risk of aerosol formation. 
- Manometry and pH-MII monitoring should only be performed in low-risk patients. 
- Anorectal manometry is hardly ever urgent and should be restricted to low-risk patients.
- For esophageal manometry and pH, pH-MII and wireless pH-capsule monitoring, adjust height of bed so that the upper part of the patient’s head is under the chin of the nurse or technician.
- For esophageal manometry: 
-- Apply lubricating gel containing a local anesthetic on the catheter.
-- Avoid use of sprays with local anesthetic due to risk of aerosol formation.
-- During insertion of catheter, mask should still be worn over the mouth, exposing the nose only.
- For anorectal manometry: “as defecation is considered an aerogenic process and SARS-CoV-2 particles can potentially be shed via feces, a toilet in a separate room is preferred over in-room commode seat.”","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3RfNwyz4tl7UNLf"",""description"":""delete""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_2pR9O3vh9bkw2py"",""description"":""delete""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3KpFOigld1NMQGE"",""description"":""delete""}]","Other","Guidelines and Recommendations",

- In the US, some providers have reduced the number of in-person prenatal visits (from an average of 12-14 to 5) by teaching women self-monitoring and documentation for things such as number of kicks and blood pressure.
- Telehealth may be difficult for women with co-morbidities, women with limited internet access, or women who require a physical examination of breasts or genitalia.
- The pandemic has led to reductions in family planning services and in-person services for survivors of sexual violence. There has been a 10% reduction in use of contraceptives which could result in an extra 15 million unintended pregnancies. Sexual violence survivors are reduced to more telehealth services where in-person contact is not feasible and sometimes have to self-swab for DNA collection. Research must continue to evaluate these health care changes and use empirical data and experiences of health care workers and patients to guide future decision-making.
- In a worldwide survey of maternal and newborn healthcare workers, 60% of respondents reported not having access to enough PPE. There were similar findings for surveys in the UK, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Iran, and other countries. These workers also have concerns about being forgotten about in terms of PPE access given the focus on emergency workers. The second stage of labor is considered by recent publications to be an aerosol-generating procedure leading to calls for N-95 masks, face shields, and full gowns.
- Visitor limitations during birth force women to make difficult decisions between choosing family and professional support (such as doulas) to be in the room with them during labor. Advocates are important for a good outcome, especially for low-income women and women of color, and more pressure is placed on the health care team to provide emotional support for the women.

In contrast, increased neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and subsequent interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 activation seems to increase the severity of the illness.

Viral rashes:
-Virus-induced maculopapular exanthema (Figure 6A) may biopsy to differentiate between viral exanthema from drug-induced exanthema. 
-Virus-induced vesicular eruptions: underlying mechanisms still remain unclear; further studies are needed to evaluate if these eruptions are primarily due to SARS-CoV-2. 
- Virus-induced urticarial rash: common in upper respiratory infections and may involve complement activation and serum sickness. 
- Virus-induced vasculitis: may involve immune complex-mediated mechanisms, but further studies are needed to evaluate if these lesions are primarily from SARS-CoV-2.

Previous skin diseases:
-Urticaria, psoriasis, autoimmune disease, etc. might develop from SARS-CoV-2-related reactivation or aggravation of pre-existing skin diseases. 
-Chilblain presents as ""violaceous, infiltrated, painful and sometimes even pruritic plaques on erythematous skin with predilection to back of toes and feet"" in certain COVID-19 patients and in asymptomatic or non-infected patients; its underlying mechanisms remain unclear in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cutaneous drug reactions: 
- Cutaneous drug reactions are classified into immediate and non-immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions.
- Drug-induced urticarial rashes may be involved in direct mast cell activation, immune complex formation, and activation of complement; these could be drug-induced, induced by viral RNA, or a mixture of both. 
- Drug-induced maculopapular exanthema may be a result of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to drugs and metabolites of drugs. 
- Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions with non-specific histologic findings (Figure 9A and B), such as DRESS syndrome, have been observed in COVID-19 cases; the culprit drug must be stopped immediately after identification. 

Drug-induced vasculitis:
- May be due to type III hypersensitivity reactions with changes in the vasculature or vascular pathways; 10-20% present as vasculitis, livedo racemosa, or purpura and can appear during or after drug exposure (7-14 days), depending on the drug.

The authors propose the following recommendations for discussing autopsy with family:
•	Clinicians may have a conversation about autopsy with the family either before or after the patient's death; it may also be appropriate to have this conversation with the patient.
•	They should approach the family or the patient without any assumptions regarding the family or patient’s emotional state. Cultural and religious values should be taken into consideration.
•	It may be more appropriate to use terms such as “offer,” instead of “request,” “permission,” or “consent” during a discussion about the autopsy.   
•	Clinicians should explain the procedure of the autopsy to the families and take into account the family’s preference regarding the fate of retained organs.
•	They should also communicate with the family that the findings of the autopsy will be shared and discussed with them upon the completion of the procedure.

One study found that there was an estimated 4.4% increase in COVID-19 mortality for each 1-degree latitude north of 28 degrees after adjusting for the age of the population (P=0.031) (Table 1, Figure 1). Pollution and population density per country did not significantly affect the associations. 
• The mechanism underlying the association between latitude and COVID-19 mortality is not particularly clear and may involve multiple factors. One factor identified was ultraviolet light, particularly UVB, was shown to have immunosuppressive effects on the skin. 
• There is contradictory evidence suggesting UV light reduces free virus viability with one study reporting that UVB and higher temperature were associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. However, a study in China did not find an association between either UVB or temperature and COVID-19 infection rates.   
• Evidence from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency may have an impact on the inflammatory response, and therefore the severity of the infection in respiratory diseases. One study found that infants with bronchiolitis and lower levels of vitamin D were more likely to need intensive care (22% of vitamin D &lt;20ng/ml (50 nmol/l), compared with 12% if vitamin D &gt;30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l); P=0.003).
• Experimental lab evidence demonstrated that while vitamin D may have inconsistent effects on viral replication in human respiratory epithelial cell culture, vitamin D markedly down-regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNFalpha and IL-6) by various mechanisms including inhibition of viral-induced NF-kappaB activation. 
• Evidence suggests the immunosuppressive effects of Vitamin D may differ among men and women. The observed gender difference is speculated to be related to estrogen-dependent effects on the synthesis of the vitamin D binding protein. 
• It was suggested that vitamin D may play a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19. However, exact mechanism was not discussed

High altitude areas, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Tibet have lower rates of COVID-19, which Reyes et al. (2020) suggest could be due to direct effects of increased UV radiation on the virus or a physiological adaptation to the renin-angiotensin system at high altitudes that minimizes SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2. However, there are many other external variables that affect these communities and could impact transmission of COVID-19 (Figure 1). It is well-established that high-altitude communities have lower rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity, both of which are risk factors for a negative COVID-19 outcome. Communities located in high altitudes also often have lower population densities. Furthermore, it was noted during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico that high altitude was associated with worse disease outcome. When all of these variables are taken into account, it is difficult to isolate high altitude as the reason that COVID-19 transmission appears to be lower in these communities.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_DuRYhYv95x193Jn"",""description"":""**Figure 1:** Parameters of high altitude exposure and adaptations.

-Childhood vaccinations may confer a degree of cross-protection against coronaviruses. The BCG vaccination has been touted for its proposed ability to elicit a phenomenon referred to as “trained immunity” by which it induces epigenetic changes in innate immune cells creating alterations that stimulate a more robust adaptive immune response. 

-A larger thymus in children may allow for increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation which attenuates the deleterious inflammation and pathogenic cytokine storm induced by the virus.

- COVID-19 prevention: dual fabric (i.e. cotton and silk/flannel) and nanostructured graphene masks useful for enhanced viral filtering, sterilizing and reuse.
- Coronavirus diagnosis: nanotechnology CoV detection methods (Figure 1) are highly sensitive and specific thereby useful in avoiding false positive/negative results as seen in standard detection methods (i.e. PCR).
- Nanoformulated anticoronavirus vaccines (Figure 2): often resulted in greater efficacy than non-nanoformulated counterparts but more research is needed to confirm suspicions (Table 1).
- Antiviral nanomaterial drugs (Figure 2): hypothesized to be beneficial via blocking CoV replication, inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, enhancing immune response, and reducing CoV-induced apoptotic cell death.
- Indirect treatment/detection: nanomaterials may be used for detection of a disturbed host microbiome to indirectly reveal a COVID-19 infection, or aid in local delivery of drugs to the gut to fight COVID-19 by restoring healthy microbiome.

Despite promising findings, authors recognize the need for further research on nanotechnologies via parallel benefit/risk ratio studies on nanomaterial-based treatments in COVID-19, as well as suitable animal models to examine drug efficacy in humans (including dose and administration route).

In addition to recognizing the clinical differences of COVID-19 infections in endocrinology, the authors also discuss possible sex differences. Current studies have mixed results on ACE2 regulation between males versus females. Some studies suggest that since ACE2 is located on the X chromosome, the ACE2 enzyme may be regulated differently in men (XY) than in women (XX). Other studies have shown no difference in ACE2 overall gene expression, suggesting that the regulation is similar between the sexes. In response to this dissonance, the authors instead discuss TMPRSS2, a direct androgen receptor target gene expressed in both males and females, as a possible contributor affecting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and its pathogenicity along with ACE2. However, more data is needed is study how gene expression levels are associated with the comorbidities related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_1EYiBPwTVOmxSXb"",""description"":""Figure 1: Patterns of gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across select human\ntissues and pancreatic islet cells.

1. Nucleic acid-based: This approach uses host cellular machinery to generate antigens and a subsequent immune response to the virus. These have good biocompatability and potentially rapid, inexpensive, and scalable manufacturing.
2. Viral vectors: This technique relies on delivering antigens encoded in a modified virus to stimulate an immune response. These prompt strong immune responses and allow for targeted delivery.
3. Protein subunit based: These typically must involve a capsid or envelop protein in order to enable immunity. There is reduced immunogenecity with protein subunit based vaccines compared to other approaches, often necessitating booster doses.
4. Live attenuated: These involve less virulent versions of a virus and can induce a strong immune response but carry the risk of causing disease.
5. Killed inactivated: These cannot replicate to cause disease and are thus safer than the live attenuated strains. However, killed inactivated vaccines may have reduced efficacy compared to the live attenuated vaccines.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_1Fy496UW5ITZf9O"",""description"":""Figure 1.

Anti-inflammatory effects of PARPi’s included the prevention of asthma and lung fibrosis in animal models and decreased expression of IL-6 in the lungs of animal models and in human serum, though less evidence was available to support the authors' position regarding viral replication. The authors concluded PARPi’s are safe and warrant clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness in COVID-19 and ARDS.

The researchers determined:
•	IgM response in mildly ill patients is lower than that of the severely ill (Figure 2).
•	Sputum and urine cultures of severely ill patients showed less IgM, and no antibody in stool.
•	Patient antibodies preferentially recognized the spike protein S2 fragment (p&lt;0.0001), with 100% seroconversion against S2 and S fragments (Figure 4).
•	Cross reactivity of antibodies of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was shown to have a strong response (p ≤ 0.000033).
•	Neutralizing antibodies were found in 73.9% of patients 3 weeks post disease onset, with higher titers being in the severely ill group and that activity of neutralization was correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody response to S and N proteins (Pearson r = 0.5393, P &lt; 0.0001 for S; r = 0.6709, P &lt; 0.0001 for N) (Figure 6).

Some key findings that the researchers found include:
•	A mean increase of 2.3 sexual partners was reported by participants during COVID-19 lockdown (Table 3).
•	HIV and other STI screenings were prevented by COVID-19 lockdown measures in approximately one-third of the group (32.2% and 29.3% respectively) (Table 3).
•	COVID-19 lockdown prevented 8.9% of respondents from accessing HIV PrEP (Table 3).
•	Participants reported an increase in number of anal sex partners, with a mean increase of 2.1 during COVID-19 lockdown (Table 4).
This study shows high levels of sexual activity in the GBMSM group during the COVID-19 lockdown and the lack of basic health service or access, such as routine STI testing and HIV PrEP, suggesting for the implementation of strategies to ensure that populations needing these services will have access to them, even during a pandemic.

In comparing sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, the authors note that FDPs and D-dimer tend to be predictors of severity in COVID-19 disease, while platelet count and PT prolongation are related to sepsis severity and mortality in DIC. The authors also offer potential pharmaceutical candidates, namely dipyridamole, that may be able to reduce both the coagulation and inflammatory responses of COVID-19 infection. Based on these observations, the authors suggest a need for randomized controlled trials of anticoagulants in COVID-19 and further investigation into optimal management of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.","Vasc Med. 2020 Jun 19:1358863X20932640. doi: 10.1177/1358863X20932640.

""Evidence on the efficacy of masks is confounded by whether or not they are being used in a pandemic; whether by health-care workers or the public, and by the concomitant use of hand-washing, social distancing and other personal protective equipment. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of pre-COVID-19[sic] showed that surgical masks or N95 respirators reduced clinical respiratory illness in health-care workers by 41% and influenza-like illness by 66%: they work but are far from perfect. N95 masks were not statistically better than surgical masks in preventing proven influenza, nor in preventing COVID-19, although the latter is based on weak data. N95 masks are more efficient filters of small particles, but these findings suggest it is reasonable to recommend that health-care workers use surgical masks when there is risk of droplet spread and reserve preciousN95 masks for health-care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures…As [surgical masks] become moist they become porous and no longer protect. Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap theSARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. Thus, a pre-symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a face mask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others.""

Key points include:

1) Clinical services that were in demand prior to the pandemic may not be the same ones patients feel they need in a post-pandemic world. Hospitals should be aware of this and react to patient desires.

2) Hospitals cannot take for granted that patients will believe that the hospital or clinical process is safe. Hospitals must be proactive in showing patients that they will be safe, even before patients arrive.

3) Patients have never felt in control in the healthcare setting, and the pandemic has only exacerbated that feeling. Hospitals must actively provide that sense of control to patients, which in large part depends on letting patients know what will happen to them and when.

4) Hospitals must make patients feel safe in a way that is not alarming, depending on the context of each clinical setting. Hospitals must be self-aware of their precautions and safety mechanisms to provide a comforting environment for patients.","JAMA Intern Med. 2020 May 27. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2626.

For example, the Mayo Clinic announced furloughs and hour reductions for 30 000 workers to stem a projected $3 billion loss.1 And of course hospitals are fundamentally in the business of serving the health care needs of their communities. Those needs did not press the pause button just because hospitals did.

Outside of health care, discussions about reopening the economy focus on how to return to work. However, the real engines of the economy are not the producers of goods and services but the consumers of them. Stories from hospitals trying to restart clinical services suggest that many patients do not yet feel that it is safe to come back.

Current evidence is lacking in support of vertical transmission of SARs-CoV-2 and reports fail to demonstrate that the virus is transmitted in human milk, but a general consensus is that the health benefits associated with breastfeeding in COVID-19 positive mothers outweighs the risks of not doing so. These recommendations have important implications for health and wellbeing for nursing children and their caretakers, and include the following:

-Authors recommend that mothers wear a surgical mask while breastfeeding or during intimate contact to mitigate infecting infants via respiratory route.
-Authors also emphasize the importance of hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces as well as thoroughly cleaning plastic and glass milk containers as the virus can remain stable on these materials for several days. 
-Human milk donation and milk banking has been negatively impacted by COVID-19, but methods of pasteurization are being investigated.
-Due to milk supply shortages, the authors suggest allocating human milk “to  the  smallest  and  most  at  risk preterm  infants  (e.g.,  birth  weight  &lt;1500  grams  or  a  gestational  age  &lt;30  weeks)  to  prevent  NEC  and  other  severe  illnesses  occurring  in  these  extremely  fragile  infants.”

• Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for all patients who require hospital admission for COVID-19 in the absence of any contraindications such as active bleeding and a platelet count less than 250 × 103 /µL. 
• Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as the anticoagulant of choice with Fondaparinux as an alternative in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or aversion to receipt of porcine derivatives.
• Consider a 3-tiered approach to stratifying anticoagulation intensity. This includes low-intensity anticoagulation (tier I), intermediate-intensity anticoagulation (tier II), and therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (tier III).
• In the setting of renal dysfunction, use of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) along with anti–factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring may be preferable.
• Transition patients on oral anticoagulation at home to therapeutic-dose LMWH or parenteral UFH infusion for the duration of hospitalization unless contraindications exist

Patient selection for tiered anticoagulation therapy:

• Tier I anticoagulation: Low acuity patients, those without known thrombi or known malignancy; D-dimer levels less than 3 times the ULN that are not trending upward. Dose examples include enoxaparin 40mg sc once daily to q12hourly; renal adjustments of enoxaparin 30 mg sc daily.
• Tier II anticoagulation: Higher risk patients (clinically deteriorating, with an upward trend in inflammatory marker and/or D-dimer levels). Risk stratification models (Caprini score, IMPROVE risk score, and Padua Prediction Score models) can be used to determine suitability. Enoxaparin 40 mg sc every 12 hours may be an option for patients with a BMI of &lt;40.
• Tier III anticoagulation: Patients with COVID-19 with known or strongly suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), presenting with acute coronary syndrome or  D-dimer greater than 6 times the ULN. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg sc q12hrly (for patients with creatinine clearance [CLcr] above 30 mL/min).
• In clinically brittle patients with increasing oxygen needs, mechanical ventilation or organ failure, consider prophylactic treatment.

Agent selection for tiered anticoagulation therapy (Figure 1):

• Tier I anticoagulation: LMWH at standard prophylactic doses with dose considerations for obese patients (BMI &gt;40) and renal disease. Assaying anti-Xa levels therapeutic levels may be done in obese patients. Fondaparinux may replace heparin where needed.
• Tier II anticoagulation: Consider higher-than-standard doses as needed. Initiate VTE doses in suspected cases until ruled out.
• Tier III anticoagulation: Stepped up dosing recommendations for high-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Discharge considerations:

• Regardless of tier, assess all patients for need for prophylaxis and ongoing anticoagulation therapy. Factors to consider include prolonged immobility while in quarantine, D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. 
• Consider patient-specific factors such as insurance and cost considerations, duration of prophylactic therapy and bleeding risk. 
• Extending prophylaxis up to 45 days may be appropriate in patients at increased risk for VTE who are at low risk for bleeding.
• Upon discharge of patients with confirmed or suspected VTE, continuation of anticoagulation treatment for minimum 3 months for provoked VTE can be chosen. Treatment with therapeutic-dose LMWH or DOAC therapy can be considered in preference to warfarin, in accordance with current guidelines. 
• If VTE is not confirmed at time of discharge due to lack of test availability, the clinician may wish to treat according to conventional protocols for VTE. 
•  Follow-up with primary care or specialty providers for ongoing re-evaluation and extension of therapy.

Risk screening was conducted based on travel history, occupation, contacts, and clusters (TOCC) to assess need for 14 day home isolation/quarantine.

- General hygiene measures: focused on travel restrictions, PPE/sanitization utilization, hand washing, social distancing (5 feet indoors, 3.3 feet outdoors), and wearing masks indoors. Dormitories were regulated closely via restricted entry/exit at a single checkpoint with a screening station (temperature checks). Transparent dividers were also placed on each table of the cafeteria.

- Ventilation and sanitization: introduced ventilation policy to leave doors open (CO2 concentration maintained at &lt;1000ppm). Detailed guidance on cleaning procedures (areas requiring particular attention, cleaning chemical formulas) was implemented.

- Suspected case reporting: When a confirmed/suspected case was present, university health center staff reported to the local health department and the school conducted contact tracing with health status monitoring of all contacts.

- School closures and make-up classes: If 1 confirmed case was identified, all of that person's classes were to be suspended. If a university had 2 confirmed cases, it was to close altogether and initiate online courses for at least 14 days. Students were allowed to apply for delayed registration/tuition payment, return of tuition, or online courses. The university also offered an extension to fulfill graduation requirements.

-Quarantine implementation: For international students, universities were responsible for transporting students from the airport to the quarantine location (independent dormitory or other private room). 14 day isolation was initiated, and temperatures were checked twice daily. Quarantined students were allowed to live at home if they had a single room and private bathroom but were required to move to a designated hotel if at risk individuals (elderly, those with chronic disease, children) were in their household.

• The authors relate growing evidence for AYA being more likely to experience no or only mild symptoms compared to older age cohorts.

**Potential risk factors for SARS‐COV‐2 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases**
-On immunosuppressive agents
-Chronic kidney disease, eg lupus nephritis
-With lung involvement, eg interstitial lung disease
-Elderly patients
-Frequently visiting medical clinic
-With underlying health conditions, such as smoking, obesity, hypertension and diabetes
-Pregnancy
**Medication for patients with rheumatic diseases**
-Continue current treatment if disease is stable, and contact your doctor for suitable medicine if disease has flared
-Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and sulphasalazine (SLZ) should be continued and should not increase the risk of infection
-Use of other conventional synthetic disease‐modifying drugs (csDMARDs, eg methotrexate, leflunomide) and immunosuppressants (eg cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus) should be continued
-Corticosteroid use can be continued
-A new prescription of immunosuppressant or increase in dose of an ongoing immunosuppressant would need to be carefully discussed in epidemic areas
-Use of all biologic DMARDs should be continued if possible
-If infliximab infusion is not accessible, switching to other anti‐tumor necrosis factor injection at home is encouraged
-Targeted synthetic DMARDs (Janus‐activated kinase [JAK] inhibitors) including tofacitinib/baricitinib/upadacitinib can be continued
**Surgery**
-Postpone elective surgery, eg joint replacement surgery
-Screening for COVID‐19 (symptoms suggestive of COVID‐19, complete blood count, nasopharyngeal swab and chest X‐ray or chest computed tomography according to local recommendation) before emergency surgery
**Patients with rheumatic disease and fever**
-Contact your rheumatologist about potential option to visit fever outpatient clinic with personal protection provisions if temperature continues over 38°C
-Patients must not suddenly stop prednisolone
-Suspend the use of immunosuppressants and biological agents after consultation with your rheumatologist, and follow appropriate local guidance for suspected COVID‐19 if COVID‐19 cannot be ruled out
-Patients can continue HCQ and SLZ if they are infected with COVID‐19.

- Molecular testing: Nucleic acid amplification tests are currently the gold-standard for diagnosing suspected cases of COVID-19, of which real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is most commonly employed.
- Pre-analytical considerations: Both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens are suitable for collection. Testing should be employed when viral load is potentially at its peak. For throat swabs, viral load is maximal in first 5 days after symptom onset.
- Analytical considerations: Viral recombination or mutation may affect accuracy of testing.
- Serology testing: Includes analyses of plasma, serum, or whole blood for detecting antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Common methods include disposable immunochromatographic lateral flow assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, or chemiluminescent immunoassays. 
- Pre-analytical considerations: Seroconversion occurs between 7 and 14 days after symptom onset. Sensitivity of tests may differ considerably among different clinical populations.
- Analytical considerations: Cross-reactivity is high among SARS-CoV-2 samples. 
- Biochemical monitoring: Biochemical, hemotological, and immunohistochemical laboratory testing is routinely employed to monitor disease progression and severity and guide treatment.

3. Guidelines written for adult patients should clearly direct clinicians to the corresponding paediatric guidelines and paediatric guidelines should be actively promoted to general and paediatric clinicians.
4. Paediatric critical care services, in conjunction with adult services, should locally assess the most effective ways to support the adult sector.
5. Clinicians working in general hospitals should have 24‐h access to specialist paediatric input for prioritisation decisions involving children, and should make the need for this explicit in their local guidelines.
6. In prioritising intensive care resources, it is ethically reasonable to consider according children some priority.
7. PICU should work closely with general paediatrics, palliative care, and other subspecialty services to optimise timely goals of care discussions and parallel planning. Palliative care surge capacity should be part of the overall strategy to address intensive care resource limitation.
8. Decision‐making processes for determining ICU eligibility and priority should be designed in a transparent and consultative way. All decisions should be clearly documented and reviewed.

At the Mary & Dick Allen Diabetes Center in Newport, CA, patients often attended in-person diabetes education classes. However, these group classes became more limited by mid-March and were eventually cancelled as social distancing became more urgent. As a result, the diabetes center converted to 1:1 video calls with patients instructed to upload their glucose levels for routine management. However, challenges in getting the data uploaded occurred due to lack of access, compliance, or means.

Possible mechanisms for PGE2 modulation of immune cell functions in COVID-19. \n\nPGE2 likely modulates immune responses in various cell types during SARS-CoV-2 infection, influencing COVID-19 pathogenesis. In epithelial cells, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 leads to endocytosis, viral replication, and cell damage, activating RLR (RIG-1 and MAD5)-dependent production of type I and III interferons (IFNs) and the TLR-dependent NF-kB pathway. The NF-kB pathway induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines (eg. IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF), chemokines (eg. CCL2, CXCL1) and other inflammatory mediators such as COX-2 and mPGES-1, resulting in PGE2 secretion. Here, while it suppresses the production of type I (and possible type III) IFNs, PGE2, further amplifies NF-kB signaling and production of cytokines and chemokines in a positive feedback loop. PGE2 may also directly modulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression, endocytosis, and viral replication. In monocytes/macrophages, activation of NF-kB and STAT3 mediates production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines which contributes to the development of cytokine secretion syndrome (ie. cytokine storm), chemokines that recruit monocytes and neutrophils, inflammatory biomarkers (eg. SAAs, CPR, D-dimer) as well as PGE2. Here, PGE2 again represses IFN-induced expression of ISGs, contributing to delay of viral clearance. Importantly, PGE2 context-dependently affects (either positively or negatively) not only NLRP3 inflammasome activation and related IL-1b maturation but also NF-kB-dependent monocyte/macrophage cytokine production. PGE2 differentially regulates platelet aggregation via different receptors and likely inhibits NETosis associated with inflammation and thrombosis. PGE2 also down-regulates IFN-gamma production and cytotoxicity of NK and CD8 T cells that kill cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 but promotes differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells, the chief cellular sources of the cytokine storm at late stages of COVID-19.""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3Ia8xwRxRxamxnd"",""description"":""Figure 4.

1. Aerosolization
-Particles were sprayed into the cadaver's nasal cavities, the body was ventilated, and aerosols were measured in a 4-quadrant field (Figure 3). 
- 2.5 mL of fluorescein (AK-FLOR® 10%, 100 mg/mL) was used to coat the nasal cavity for each trial
- Analysis Protocol: ""Endoscopic images of each quadrant were exported for analysis and uploaded to Image J (version 1.52v). Images underwent brightness and contrast adjustment to 0-pixel intensity and filtering with a minimum of 1 pixel and were converted into grayscale and underwent thresholding with a lower limit of 0 and an upper limit of 100. Images with droplets present underwent particle analysis to determine the number of droplets present in each image."" 
- Both devices resulted in subjective reductions in the amount of ""spillage"" of particles compared to no device (Table 1 and 2). 
2. Surgical freedom (SF) 
- Defined as the ""maximum area in which a surgeon is able to move the proximal end of the instrument while the distal end is fixed on a target."" 
- The 3D-printed mask allowed for the highest degree of SF (100%) in both posterior and anterior nasal procedures. 
- The modified trocar reduced SF (55%) in anterior nasal procedures, but maintained subjectively 'appropriate' SF in posterior procedures from the testing surgeon's experience.

They explain that IgY is functionally equivalent to human IgG and has therapeutic and diagnostic applications for Salmonella species, Pseudomonas, Influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus, and Vibrio cholera infections. Since it does not react with mammalian Fc receptors, it can be safely administered to egg-allergic patients as well as pregnant and immunodeficient individuals. Furthermore, IgY can be extracted in considerable quantities from egg yolks at low cost and may be purified by ammonium sulfate, PEG, and chromatographic techniques. Thus, the authors suggest the IgY may serve a novel role against SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2, likely through inflammasome activation, leads to stimulation of infiltrating macrophages that can promote hyperinflammation, characterized by increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, ferritin and subsequent possible lung fibrotic complications. The increased ferritin production allows adequate storage of iron and deprives the pathogen of iron. Labile iron in the cell contributes to the formation of reactive oxygen species that further promote tissue damage and fibrosis. Iron accumulates in the reticuloendothelial macrophages and the shedding of CD163 is the marker of macrophage activation. Iron chelation therapy can interrupt these steps. (a) Deferoxamine (DFO) has a direct effect on ferritin since promotes ferritin degradation in lysosomes by inducing autophagy. Both deferiprone and deferasirox are likely to chelate cytosolic iron and iron which is extracted from ferritin prior to ferritin degradation by proteasomes. (b) DFO can induce an up-regulation of IFN-γR2 expression on the cell surface on activated T cells thus restoring T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The limited size of the review and the lack of standardized reporting of data are drawbacks that make this review of limited utility in a clinical context.

- Stream 1: COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF)
-- Among three studies comparing non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 1 suggested an increase in mortality with NIV and 2 suggested a reduction in mortality with NIV. 
-- No studies that reported contextual factors for decision making about NIV in COVID-19

- Stream 2: Randomized control trials assessing the use of NIV in the management of HRF in non-COVID-19 patients
-- No reduction in mortality but a reduction in the need for IMV with the administration of high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC)
-- HFNC has no effect on mortality or escalation of ventilatory support

- Stream 3: Mechanistic, Animal, Human, Foundational Science, Preclinical and Other Studies Describing the Risk for Transmission From aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
-- One study reported a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the intensive care setting where patients were ventilated

- Stream 4: Human studies on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
-- Studies found an increased risk for transmission with tracheal intubation, NIV, manipulation of a BiPAP mask, and manual ventilation before intubation","Ann Intern Med. 2020 May 22. doi: 10.7326/M20-2306.

It was observed that viral interactomes varied among cell types: 
• Vero E6 and ACE2-A549 cells were most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 GFP-reporter virus. 
• Caco-2 cells demonstrated lower infectability and Calu-3 cells showed no infection (Fig. 2C). 
The study also presented a “physical and spectral library of 98 stable isotope-labeled, synthetic peptides representing 11 viral proteins along with optimized parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays that were tested on two diagnostic cohorts of in total 91 COVID-19 suspected individuals.” Their results revealed: 
• Although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in cells is an important factor for pathogenicity in olfactory epithelium, they are not found in the lungs despite the severity of disease in this area. 
• There was a down regulation of proteins responsible for innate immunity such as GBP1 and MASP1 at high viral loads, which was not observed with lower viral loads. 
• As anticipated, 24 hours after infection, viral protein expression increased substantially and could be detected by proteomics (Fig. 3A).
• Five of twenty-four COVID-19 PCR-positive cases were also positive by PRM on LC-MS/MS system (Fig. 5C), and all PCR-negative cases were also negative by PRM. 
Although large population testing for COVID-19 will continue to rely on PCR-based detection, the authors believe the results of this study reveal potential for proteomics to have a clinical role in therapeutic stratification of COVID-19 patients as well as monitoring recovery.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_1LjLtzHKo2ar862"",""description"":""Figure 2.

It is also important to determine how to notify patients of the change in guidelines. Their recommendations are as follows:
1. Defer STI screening visits: For most patients, deferring an STI screening test is very low-risk because serious complications from most STIs are extremely rare, and generally do not develop over a short period of time. The authors suggest the risk of contracting COVID-19 is greater than the risk of a delayed STI screening test.
2. Treat patients with STIs or known exposure via telemedicine and oral medication: Oral medication is available for nearly every STI. Although first-line treatment for gonorrhea and syphilis are injectable both have highly efficacious oral alternatives. For recommendations on oral medications see Table 1.
3. Triage patients over the phone: Most patients with STI symptoms can be correctly diagnosed via telemedicine and with the practitioner using local epidemiological data. For treatment options for common STI symptoms see Table 2.
4. Provide in-person care to certain high-risk STI's such as patients with acute HIV and patients with complicated syphilis or syphilis during pregnancy: High-risk STI's require in-person visits for a variety of reasons. For individuals with syphilis during pregnancy, an injection of benzathine penicillin is required. Complicated syphilis, which includes systemic symptoms, can cause blindness and deafness if not properly treated. Currently, the only treatment available is intramuscular injections. For patients with suspected HIV, a laboratory diagnosis is required, which must be done in-clinic.

-Both TMPRSS2 and FURIN were expressed in AT2 cells of normal lungs, but only FURIN was found in fibrotic lungs, suggesting that FURIN alone is sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells of fibrotic lungs.
-Higher ACE2-positive rates in failed heart cells, which authors suggest may allow the virus to spread to the heart from the lungs and play a role in multi-organ involvement and cardiac injury.
-Lower ACE2 expression in arterial vascular cells of failed hearts, which could correlate with weak infectability of the heart.
-Normal hearts showed expression of viral response genes compared to failed hearts which expressed more inflammatory markers.
-ACE2 lung expression in human carcinoma and mice tissue was upregulated in response to viral infection and LPS inflammation, respectively, suggesting that previous viral infection or inflammatory states may make patients more susceptible to COVID-19.

Lungs:
-Authors found five major cell types in normal and fibrotic lung tissue (type I and type II alveolar cells (AT1, AT2), ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and vascular cells) based on molecular features.
-In normal lung tissue, AT2 cells were found to express ACE2; in fibrotic lungs, ACE2 was expressed mainly in arterial vascular cells and rarely In AT2. Authors propose that this difference in ACE2 expression supports hematogenous spread of COVID-19 from the lungs.
-Chemokines (CCL2, CXCL12) and complement component (C1R) were highly expressed in ACE2-positive arterial vascular cells of fibrotic lungs and had lower expression of ACE2-positive AT2 cells of normal lungs, suggesting an association with the inflammatory response.
-Both TMPRSS2 and FURIN were expressed in AT2 cells of normal lungs, but only FURIN was expressed in arterial vascular cells of fibrotic lungs, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might depend on FURIN in fibrotic lungs.

Hearts:
-Authors identified four major cells types in normal hearts and heart failure hearts (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, vascular cells, and immune cells).
-Cells in failed hearts showed higher ACE2-positive rate than normal hearts (7.60% of all cells vs. 5.88% of all cells) and lower expression of ACE2 in arterial vascular cells of failed hearts compared to normal (7.93% of arterial vascular cells vs. 19.4% of arterial vascular cells).
-Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of ACE2-expressing arterial vascular cells in normal hearts showed that highly expressed genes were associated with viral infection response. Failed heart cells expressed SOX4 and MEF2C (regulators of monocyte and B cell differentiation), possibly related to the inflammatory response.

RSV/MERS-CoV:
-Using RNA-seq data, ACE2 expression significantly was upregulated in lung carcinoma cells 
infected with RSV and MERS-CoV. ACE2 expression in pulmonary endothelial cells of mice was upregulated after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection.
-From these results, authors conclude that viral infection or inflammation (LPS) may make the patient more susceptible to COVID-19.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3n6LqJyDfpFDHCB"",""description"":""Figure 1: Different distribution pattern of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)‐expressing cells in normal and fibrotic lungs.

While there are currently several studies underway aimed at investigating the efficacy of COVID-19 diagnostic methods (Table 1), the authors discuss available data and note the following:
- Clinical diagnoses based on clinical features and radiological findings allow for early detection; however, normal imaging does not exclude COVID-19, and verification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing studies is needed. 
- Although RT-PCR is the gold standard for molecular tests and can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different clinical specimens, it requires excessive equipment, presents possibilities for error, and requires time for testing. Closed-tube Penn-RAMP is a novel assay designed to simplify detection. Both of these tests can quantify viral load and reproducibly determine infection status.
- Serological assays such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA), rapid antigen tests, and lateral flow assay (LFA) can be useful for the identification of antibodies in bodily fluids, but are uncommonly used due to commercial reagent limitations.

These interventional trials seek to recruit over two million participants, forcing competition for enrolling patients into trials. Many of these trials have similar interventions and are running independently of one another. As an example, there are currently 178 registered trials with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as an intervention for COVID-19. Because these trials are generally run independently, there is limited awareness of other trials, causing data fragmentation, which ultimately leads to slower results regarding efficacy and safety. Many trials are running independently, however, there are several, such as the Solidarity trial run by the World Health Organization conducting large-scale collaborative randomized clinical trials. 

Because there are multiple stages and presentations of COVID-19 infection, there is a good reason to conduct multiple trials on the same intervention. Conducting trials of the same medication for prophylaxis, early-stage of the disease, or in critically-ill patients is important in determining when an intervention is safe and efficacious. 

Because of all these challenges, the authors stress the importance of collecting and analyzing all the data available.

- SARS-CoV-2 infected host transcriptional response also revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared to the other pneumonia cohort and no expression changes in ACE2 were observed.(Figure 4).
- 16 differential gene expression pathways in the COVID-19 positive cohort were observed, with 8 pathways being immune signaling related, with cytokine, immune system, and neutrophil degranulation signaling pathways being significantly enhanced (Figure 4).
- Sequencing of the host signature allowed for identification of 4/38 COVID-19 positive patients that would have been missed if only testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Figure 5).

The plots compare the probability of team failure for five different scheduling designs. The designs simulated vary by whether they are staggered versus un-staggered, whether they have 8-hour nurse shifts versus 12-hour nurse shifts, and whether nurses work consecutive days versus work alternating days. Note that in our simulations with nurses working consecutive days, when the physician rotations are sufficiently short, the nurses work the same number of consecutive days as the physician do; however, if the physician rotations are too long, the nurses are scheduled to work as many consecutive days as possible without exceeding 48 hours of work in the span of one week, and without exceeding 36 hours/week on average.

Additionally, a legislation decree allowed those with sentences under 18 months, or sentences with less than 18 months left to serve, to be placed under house arrest. 
•	The Justice ministry also passed an initiative to develop pre-triage for prisoners with three classifications. Symptomatic prisoners (i.e., fever, sore throat, respiratory difficulty, and COVID-19 related pneumonia) will be treated according to guidelines developed by the Health Ministry. Prisoners with few symptoms, but a negative COVID-19 test, will be evaluated by the penitentiary physician and local health care providers. Lastly, asymptomatic prisoners with a positive COVID-19 test will be subjected to isolation for 14 days in a designated area while the penitentiary physician actively monitors the individual.

The authors speculate that delayed encounters such as this could be due to fearful patients concerned about contacting COVID-19 at clinical practices or difficulty in obtaining clinical care due to closed offices, suggesting the importance for hospitals to create timesaving and safe methods (COVID-19 testing, proper PPE, etc) for quickly moving patients from the ED to the operating room (OR). The second case, a 47-year-old male with a subperiosteal abscess along the orbital roof secondary to a frontal sinus mucocele, received a modified treatment of intravenous antibiotics and steroids rather than standard surgical care. This treatment was successful and avoided risk of viral transmission of surgical intervention, illustrating that otolaryngologists should evolve standard practice during the pandemic without jeopardizing care of the patient. Similarly, a third case of a 67-year-old woman with severe Graves' disease and compressive optic neuropathy has shown improvement with teprotumumab rather then preceding with surgical decompression.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_2anMKatj5vJBqQD"",""description"":""Figure 1.

SARS-CoV-2 employs two routes for host cell entry, which are dependent on the localization of the proteases required for activation of the S protein. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cellular receptor, ACE2, can result in uptake of virions into endosomes, where the S protein is activated by the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin B/L. Activation of the S protein by cathepsin B/L can be blocked by HCQ and quercetin. Alternatively, the S protein can be activated by TMPRSS2, resulting in fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane. Activation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 can be blocked by bromhexine. Quercetin also blocks viral replication via inhibition of the viral cysteine protease 3CLpro. (Adapted from Simmons et al. [24])""}]","Other",,

The authors use the controversy surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to demonstrate how the COVID-19’s public profile may undermine ethical concepts of evidence-based clinical practice, drive unsustainable resource allocation, and authorize structural forms of coercive consent.","J Med Ethics. 2020 Jul 9:medethics-2020-106306. doi: 10.1136/medethics-2020-106306. Online ahead of print.","J Med Ethics","[""Aquino YSJ"","" Cabrera N.""]","Insufficient Evidence
•	The authors highlight the ethical impact of COVID-19’s public profile on the unapproved or emergency use of HCQ to treat COVID-19, without sufficient clinical evidence. The authors point to the common agreement in the current literature that while there is uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of HCQ to treat COVID-19, HCQ has sufficient potential to warrant randomized control trial (RCT) investigation. While awaiting the results of the HCQ RCT, the authors believe that there will be two main positions regarding HCQ: one that supports the HCQ off-label use, and one that does not consider the HCQ use and urges clinicians to provide supportive care alone to avoid possible adverse events from unproven therapy. The authors call to attention that supporting either position is by nature subjective and requires continued ethical scrutiny while awaiting results from RCT. 

Unsustainable allocation: 
•	They argue that COVID-19’s public profile has caused issues regarding resource allocation. The authors believe the government and hospital policies as well as public figure endorsement in HCQ to treat COVID-19 have created an issue surrounding the fair distribution of HCQ among its indicated use (i.e., malaria and lupus) and off-label use for COVID-19. The authors highlight how one patient with lupus has been unable to receive HCQ prescription and was issued letters by her healthcare network stating that HCQ supply was being conserved for critical COVID-19 patients. 

Coercive consent 
•	The authors argue that COVID-19’s public profile influences patient consent to participate in research trials. When the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency authorization for HCQ, there was a shared concern that if off-label therapy of HCQ was offered outside the context of RCT, potential participants may be less motivated to enroll in a trial. Withholding an off-label HCQ may provide incentives for participants to enroll in RCT. However, the authors warn clinicians and administrators that withholding an off-label agent such as HCQ in the course of care functions as an inducement to consent to enroll in the RCT. Moreover, the authors call to attention that participants who may be randomized to the placebo arm may not have initially agreed to receive supportive care alone.

- African continents contributed 90 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 out of 7,700 genomic sequences collected worldwide. More data needs to be submitted in order to help develop vaccines that will address African-specific strains.
- By April 18th, there were a total of 19,895 confirmed cases in Africa with a mortality rate of 5.1%, and cases were seen in all countries of Africa except for Lesotho and Comoros. South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Cameroon are most affected so far.

Vulnerability:
- Infectious disease burden (HIV, HBV, and HCV) and noncommunicable disease burden are already very high, placing the African population at relatively immunocompromised states
- Weak healthcare sectors involving infrastructures and trained workforce place additional challenges
- Seasonal respiratory viruses are anticipated to circulate from May through September, 2020

Preparedness:
- By March 6,2020, only 43 African countries were able to test for COVID-19
- Many African countries have low capacity in managing the disease burden, but options to learn from other countries and some financial support from various agencies was scheduled

Economic Impact:
- Inflation of the African markets due to reduction of importation from China 
- Countries relying on crude oil price were hit by reduced oil consumption globally
- Global travel restrictions and port closures reduced the demand and investment for the mining industry
- Reduced tourism

The authors assert that this question is actually multifaceted in that not only does the public want to know when the vaccine will be ready but also within the question lies subtext related vaccination issues beyond time-frames. The authors believe that the question of “when will we have a vaccine?” actually means:
•	When will the vaccine be available?
•	Will the vaccine be safe?
•	Will the uptake of the vaccine be enough to return to prepandemic levels?
The authors further expound on the ideas of what is needed to properly roll out a new vaccine and for it to be successful. They believe that due to recent politicization of the pandemic there needs to be a commitment from the FDA and drug manufacturers to having information that is easily understood and readily available to the public about the safety and effectiveness of the impending vaccine. They further explain that certain criteria such as prioritized groups need to be established in order to ensure that proper distribution of the vaccines are met.

The authors further assert that the public not rely on the idea that prioritized groups will take up the vaccines as assumed and that attempting to persuade ant-vaccination groups to vaccinate is difficult and often not successful. So even if a vaccine is developed, the number of estimated individuals wanting the vaccine may be lower than expected. 

Finally, the authors state that healthcare workers are highly trusted professionals in the public eye and that if a vaccine were to be successful, it would depend on the endorsement of doctors, nurses, pharmacists worldwide.

In serological practice, the “text book constellation” with IgM seroconversion preceding IgG seroconversion (a) is rather rare. Parallel determination of IgM and IgG usually represents the most frequent case (b). Delayed occurrence of IgM is less frequent (c). In several cases of acute infections, the detection of the IgM may be missed (d). This may be due to low expression of IgM response, problems of sensitivity of the assay used, competition of IgM by IgG during the assay or missing the right time point of positivity of the response. In few cases, IgM responses may persist for long times after primary infection (e). As discussed in the text, constellations a-d have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Based on the experience with SARS CoV-1 and many other viral systems, constellation e can be predicted to occur as well and may be detected as soon as longer follow up studies will have been performed. Part A shows that the determination of IgM and IgG does not allow to draw an unequivocal conclusion on the time point of infection or beginning of clinical symptoms.\n\nB. The inclusion of IgG avidity allows an unambiguous determination of early, intermediate and past infection, irrespective of the variability of the IgM response.

The authors conducted a systematic search for peer-reviewed papers published between January 1 and April 28, 2020 (search terms “smoking”, “smoker*”, “characteristics”, “risk factors”, “outcomes”, and “COVID-19”, “COVID”, “coronavirus”, “sar cov-2”, “sar cov 2”).

The authors acknowledge certain limitations in these findings, notably that they were unable to discern between history of smoking and active smokers due to inconsistency of data collection among studies. Additionally many smokers may have been classified as nonsmokers and none of the studies include e-cigarette use. Because data was collected from patients already diagnosed with COVID-19 who later admitted to smoking, the authors reiterate these data cannot speak to the effect of smoking on contraction of COVID-19. However, authors suggest that all of these limitations only serve to underestimate the negative effect that smoking has on disease progression of COVID-19, and its true negative effect is likely much higher.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_1DZi4iVJ0alVNKV"",""description"":""""}]","2","Systematic review of surveys that allow matching to local circumstances","[""Executive Summary""]"

1. Patients in Group A needed fewer days to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR test (p=0.003) and fewer days in the hospital (p=0.003). 
2. Patients in Group A had reduced ferritin serum levels on day 14 compared to baseline (p-value not significant  at 0.345) and compared to Group B (p-value not given) (Table 1).
3. Patients in Group A also had increased lymphocyte counts on day 14 compared to baseline (p-value statistically significant at 0.011 ) and compared to Group B (p-value not given) (Figure 1).

SARS‐CoV‐2 transmitted by air droplets reaches the lungs.

On the other hand, SARS‐CoV‐2 reaches the lungs again through blood circulation and interacts with ACE2 receptors on the surface of alveolar capillary endothelial cells, making the alveolar capillary endothelium the target of attack by the immune system, thus inducing a series of immune responses and aggravating lung injury. The imbalance of lymphocyte subsets characterized by the decrease of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, the increase of the number of proinflammatory Th17 cells and the increase of CD8+ cytotoxic particles, aggravated the disorder of host immune system.

- When compared to an Italian control group, Italian COVID-19 patients had an overall lower degree of ACE2 gene variability.
- In support of previous studies, a genetic component to COVID-19 susceptibility was also found, proposing that inheritance of certain ACE2 variants and variable gene expression through X-inactivation could account for differential COVID-19 morbidity among sexes and ethnic groups.

1. Hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining, which revealed evidence of general placental vascular malperfusion possibly due to hypertrophic arteriolopathy; notably, there were no signs of fetal malperfusion or micro-thrombi (Figure 1) and 
2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 which reveled the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in chorionic villi endothelial cells (Figure 2).
Current literature on COVID-19 in pregnant patients is somewhat conflicting regarding morbidity, miscarriage rates, susceptibility, and the possibility of vertical transmission; the authors posit that this case is the first report of placental SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of mild COVID-19 disease, where the patient had only symptoms of mild myalgias.","J Med Virol. 2020 Aug 4. doi: 10.1002/jmv.26386.

The authors suggest SARS-CoV-2 disruption of the renin angiotension aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to an endothelial imbalance that plays a major role in the infection and dysfunctions of the disease. The imbalance leaves the endothelium susceptible to inflammation, vasoconstriction, platelet activation, and thrombosis. Future research is warranted to determine the specific roles and potential treatments relating to this disruption, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the RAAS pathway.

- The mechanism of viral entry to the endothelium via ACE2 seen in Figure 1.
- An imbalance in the RAAS contributes to endothelial dysfunction.
- Comorbidities of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease increase infection risk.
- Endothelial dysfunction contributes to cytokine storms which can damage lung and heart tissue.
- Atypical Kawasaki disease has been reported in pediatric COVID-19 patients presenting with acute vasculitis and hyper-inflammatory shock, suggesting an infectious trigger.
- Cardiac biomarkers are suggestive of poor cardiovascular outcomes in COVID-19 patients (Table 1).
- Endothelial dysfunction and resulting cytokine storms are contributing factors to hypercoagulability and disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in COVID-19.
- Endothelial-derived biomarkers can be used to predict ARDS (Table 3).

Proposed model of the pathological effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the endothelium. Left, under conditions of endothelial quiescence binding of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated in part by ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Internalization of ACE2, and subsequent receptor interference, results in an upregulation of Ang-II (angiotensin II) and downregulation of Ang-(1-7) (angiotensin-[1-7]). Although contributing to vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, limited expression of ACE2 within a relatively quiescent endothelium may result in limited viral entry and local and systemic dysfunction. Right, paradoxically, although a dysfunctional endothelium may have higher baseline levels of ACE2, enhanced viral entry may increase the degradation of ACE2 in the lysosome, enhancing inflammation and tissue damage. The resulting downregulation of ACE2 activity, upregulation of Ang-II, and downregulation of Ang-(1-7) thereby may have a starker induction of vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis as compensatory mechanisms are abrogated.

The acute increase in sympathetic outflow may cause a neurogenic pulmonary edema as a result of impacts on lung vasculature and potentially could also lead to a hypercoaguable state through interactions with coagulation and fibronolysis pathways (Figure 2). This hypothesis needs further evaluation but suggests that future treatments must provide early intervention for both the neurogenic and pulmonary pathologies underlying SARS-CoV-2-related pulmonary edema.","ACS Chem Neurosci. 2020 Jul 2. doi: 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00370.

Patients recorded 30-second Apple Watch ECG equivalents of lead I (left wrist), lead II (left ankle), and V6 (left lateral chest) (Figure 1). The participants also underwent a standard 12-lead ECG. A cardiologist then measured RR and QT-intervals on both the Apple Watch recordings and the 12-lead ECG. Finally, a second, blinded cardiologist repeated the same measurements (interrater reliability, κ=0.92). Findings included: 
- ""Apple Watch ECG tracings allowed for adequate QT measurements when the smartwatch was worn on the left wrist in 85% of patients. This figure increased to 94% when the smartwatch was moved to alternative positions."" (Figure 1). 
- Heart rates were similar on the Apple Watch and the 12-lead (70±13 versus 69±11 bpm). 
- Eight patients were identified as high risk when measuring the QT-interval on the 12-lead, all of which were also identified by the Apple Watch. 
- In general, there was agreement between the QT-interval on the 12-lead and on the Apple Watch. 
- However, 6% of individuals in the study did not have adequate measurements on the Apple Watch due to low T-wave amplitude or baseline artifact. 
Overall, Apple Watches and other 1-lead ECGs may have the potential to aid in outpatient monitoring of COVID-19 patients at high risk for QT-interval prolongation (e.g. taking hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin).

1. Be Proactive
- Shift from elective to emergency consultations and assist patients in need of urgent care.
- Engage and promote the use of teleconsultations in outpatient clinics. 
- Create specialized units for patients who test positive for COVID-19.
2. Prevention and Education
- Educate patients vulnerable to mental illness about the importance and consequences of social isolation.
- Increase availability either online or by phone.
- Provide and promote information about general well-being during quarantine.
3. Treatments
- Rethink current treatments as access to medication may be a challenge.
- Switch prescriptions to drugs with longer half-lives as they typically have fewer adverse effects if discontinued due to delays in follow-up appointments. 
- Be aware of current or possible future interactions with COVID-19 medications.
4. Counteract and React
- Analyze the negative mental effects of COVID-19 on individuals with and without a mental health history.
-Provide psychodeducational sessions and easy access to mental health care in the work environment. 
5. Foster Education
- Foster educational experience with webinars for psychiatry residents and medical students to enhance their skills. 
- Prioritize the educational opportunity for medical students and residents to develop skills in areas such as telemedicine and suicide prevention methods.

The model discrimination was an area (95%CI) under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (0.75-0.90). The characteristics (95%CI) of the model’s diagnostic threshold, applied to the population from which it was derived, were: sensitivity, 97% (83–100%); specificity, 62% (50–74%); positive predictive value, 54% (41–98%); and negative predictive value, 98% (88–99%).

- Universal approach to suicide prevention is suggested for the general population and encourages staying connected via phone or video chat, healthy eating, exercise, and access to suicide prevention helplines, most prominently in the outpatient primary care setting.
- Selective approach to suicide prevention is suggested for populations at increased risk for suicide (previous psychiatric disorders, emotional distress, frontline healthcare workers, elderly) involving maintenance of treatment regimen, increased contact with mental health professionals, telehealth resource accessibility, and limiting access to social media news.

For the IgM antibody, the chemiluminescence method had an earlier (by about 1-2 days) positive conversion time, earlier positive results at different stages of COVID-19 disease, and an earlier downward trend in positive results than the colloidal gold method (Figure 1). Similar results were seen for the IgG antibody: earlier positive conversion time and increased slope (rate) of positive results (Figure 2). Based on these results, the authors suggest that the more sensitive chemiluminescence method may be better suited for high sample detection and early disease diagnosis, such as for suspected patients with negative nucleic acid results; the colloidal gold method may be optimal for sporadic cases and emergency due to its faster return of results and use of less sophisticated equipment.

Using a simple SIR (susceptible–infected–removed) model, researchers estimated the theoretical burden of COVID-19 on low- and middle-income countries. This model assumes that there are no pharmaceutical interventions, such as a vaccine or effective treatment discovered. Additionally, other parameters taken into account are demographics, social contact patterns, healthcare availability and quality, co-morbidities, and mitigation and suppression strategies. The authors explain that these factors are important to take into account and may vary dramatically between high-income countries and low- to middle-income countries.
2. In terms of demographics and social contact patterns, low- and middle-income countries generally have younger populations and a smaller proportion of adults over the age of 65, which is a major risk factor of mortality with COVID-19 infections (Figure 1). The number of individuals living in a household was another key difference, with low- and middle-income countries, on average, have a higher persons per household.
3. Low- and middle-income countries also have fewer high-quality healthcare resources. For example, low-income countries have on average 1.28 ICU beds per 1,000 while high-income countries have 4.68 ICU beds per 1,000 (Figure 2). This may cause hospitals to become more easily overwhelmed and interfere with proper care for COVID-19 patients.
4. Co-morbidity prevalence is another difference, with current risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) having a higher prevalence in high-income countries. However, the incidence of diseases such as Tuberculosis and HIV is higher in low- and middle-income countries and it is unknown if these are a risk factor (Figure 3).
5. Ultimately, researchers used this model to predict the amount of social distancing that results in the highest mitigation of cases. Assuming ""optimal"" mitigation strategies are followed (e.g. social distancing), the model predicts a reduction in infections between 30-38% and a decrease in mortality between 19-55%.

Three key points include:
1. For low disease prevalence, the sensitivity doesn't play a large role in the PPV or NPV; instead, the focus must be on having a very high specificity in order to achieve a clinically usable PPV (Figure 1).
2. For high disease prevalence, neither the sensitivity nor the specificity have a major impact on the PPV; however, high sensitivity is needed to obtain a clinically relevant NPV, so the focus here must be identification of a test with very high sensitivity (Figure 2).
3. In the situation where prevalence is neither low nor high, the sensitivity tends to influence the PPV and the specificity tends to influence the NPV (Figure 3), so increasing utility of a test in this situation can focus on improving either the sensitivity or specificity, or both.","Lab Med. 2020 Jul 7:lmaa045. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmaa045.

After initial COVID-19 diagnosis via nasopharyngeal swab PCR, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral basilar ground glass opacities (Figure 1) and the patient was treated with oseltamivir and hydroxychloroquine twice daily for 5 days, followed by improvement of respiratory symptoms. On day 10, a diagnosis of CRS with a monoarticular gout flare was made based on the patient's presentation with high fever (40 C), shaking chills, myalgia, severe weakness and acute kidney injury associated with significantly elevated inflammatory markers (fibrinogen, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin and IL-6), while repeat CT showed marked improvement in alveolar infiltrates (Figure 2).The patient was started on oral colchicine 1 mg twice daily and notable improvement was observed after 48 hours. He continued colchicine therapy for 14 days and subsequently his nasopharyngeal swab was negative (on two consecutive occasions), laboratory values all returned to normal range (WBC, platelet count, LDH, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, IL-6 and uric acid), ESR declined, CRP was undetectable, and he was asymptomatic.

While the authors do not provide an explicit definition, they group patients as “severely ill” versus “mildly ill,” presumably ascribing “severely ill” to ICU patients based on their demographic table (Table 1). Comparison samples were from 96 plasma donors from 2017-2018. 
They conducted a variety of analyses:
1.	Viral shedding was monitored with RT-PCR. Patients with severe disease shed virus for 30-40 days post-disease onset; most mild patients did not have detectable viral loads after 15 days (Figure 1). While they mainly detected virus in respiratory samples, virus was also present in fecal samples from severely ill patients.
2.	ELISA assays were used for serologic analysis. Patients with severe disease demonstrated plasma IgM response within 1-2 weeks, while most mild patients had no IgM response (Figure 2). Most patients had an IgG response after 10-15 days, which endured for at least six weeks. Only in severe patients was antibody detected in other body fluids (sputum, urine). All patients seroconverted against spike proteins S (aa 1-1213) and S2 (aa 686-1213) seven to 14 days after onset. 
3.	Using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fragments, the authors tested plasma response to different antigens via ELISA. All patients seroconverted against spike proteins S (aa 1-1213) and S2 (aa 686-1213) seven to 14 days after onset. They also tested cross reactivity between all six human respiratory coronaviruses and found SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins did not cross react with MERS-CoV but did with SARS-CoV. 
4.	Neutralization activity was assessed via a luciferase reporter-based pseudotype neutralization assay and focus reduction neutralization test. Severely ill patients developed higher neutralizing antibody titers than mildly ill patients, without correlation between viral load and neutralizing titer.

Indirect factors are described as slowly developing, multi-level issues which become more burdensome with prolonged demands from work. These include: 
1. Staff shortages 
2. Personal (i.e. age, work experience) and occupational factors (i.e. hospital vs. long term care setting)

 - Hysteroscopic surgeries are non-aerosolizing and can generally be performed in the outpatient setting as needed.
 - Myomas and endometriosis unresponsive to pharmacological therapies may be referred for surgical intervention depending on hospital resources.
 - Ovarian lesions determined to have risk of malignancy of ≥5% and patients with endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer should be referred to an oncologic surgical center without COVID-19 cases for intervention.
 - Proper additional personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19 should be used during surgery for those that cannot be delayed.

This finding led to authorities in the US recommending HIV positive mothers avoid breastfeeding their newborns. This change led to a stigma with breastfeeding, resulting in even HIV negative mothers switching to infant formula. After further studies were performed, it was found that after 24 months, only about 14% of breastfed babies with HIV positive mothers risked transmitting the disease. Furthermore, the babies that were fed infant formula rather than breastfeeding were more likely to die from pneumonia or diarrhea than HIV. These findings show that health practitioners and policy makers alike should think long and hard about not recommending breastfeeding in mothers with COVID-19, despite any chance of passing the disease to their infant via breastmilk.","[{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_3qa23xBFmUx4zDf"",""description"":""""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_eRmNaohvw4xSjbr"",""description"":""""}]","Other","Guidelines and Recommendations",[]

Prostate Cancer
- Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to have poorer outcomes.
- Patients with low-risk features (e.g. low prostate specific antigen (PSA), normal digital rectal exam) may defer diagnostic testing during the pandemic's critical phase. Patients with high-risk features should be tested for prostate cancer, but they should first undergo testing for the COVID-19 virus.

Localized/Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
- Patients with low risk disease can undergo active surveillance.
- Patients with high risk disease can delay radical prostatectomy up to 6 months without adverse outcomes (based on literature).
- Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy may be used to delay usage of External Radiation Therapy while hypofractionated radiation therapy can be used to reduce tumor burden.

Advanced Disease
- Minimize usage of glucocorticoids.
- Use androgen-receptor-axis therapies and androgen deprivation therapy.
- Radium-223 can be used for bone-only mets or metastatic castration-resistant disease.

Bladder Cancer
- Patients with low risk disease can delay cystoscopic surveillance.
- Recent literature has stated that transurethral resection of bladder tumor should be non-deferable for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
- Active surveillance is a viable option.
- Radical cystectomy is discouraged during the pandemic's acute phase.

Muscle invasive bladder cancer
- Bladder-sparing trimodality treatment should be an available option.
- Radical cystectomy should not be delayed for more than 90 days.

Advanced bladder cancer
- Management is individualized to patient needs and how high risk the bladder cancer is.

Upper tract urothelial cancer
- Urinary cytology and computed tomography urography should be the tools of diagnosis.
- Diagnostic ureteroscopy should not be used unless absolutely needed.
- Radical nephrouterectomy can be delayed up to 12 weeks.

Renal cell-carcinoma
- Diagnosis is based on imaging; biopsy may be delayed in small renal masses (&lt;4cm).
- Patients with T3 renal cell-carcinoma should be prioritized.
- Small renal masses and T1 renal cell-carcinoma cases can undergo active surveillance.
- Tumors removable by nephrectomy can be delayed potentially from 3-6 months.
- Nephrectomy is reserved for symptomatic metastatic cases; otherwise, active surveillance may be used.

Testicular and penile cancer
- There are not many studies around this topic for delays in treatment. In general, high risk cases are prioritized.

- What: The CDC assay (TIBMOLBIO assay) and the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay were chosen for their high sensitivity (95%).
- Who, When, Where: In the ED, testing was initially expedited for symptomatic high-risk patients (e.g. requiring ICU admission) and then expanded to include asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients (Figure 2). In the inpatient setting, there was more testing capacity, so tests were widely distributed and only withdrawn depending on availability. Testing was encouraged before any procedures or surgeries and was expanded to community populations, including prisons and health centers (Figure 4).
- Why: Diagnostic testing is important for prevention of COVID-19 spread.
- How: An interdisciplinary COVID-19 Testing Stewardship Committee was established to oversee the workflow. A COVID-19 Test Volume Dashboard (Figure 1) and COVID-19 Home Monitoring Program were implemented, and COVID-19 was incorporated into the EHR ordering workflow.

""All in all, we propose that the ideal device for managing the cytokine storm responsible for severe and critical COVID-19 cases should encompass all the features of current biosensors, that is, they should monitor the levels of several cytokines simultaneously in raw blood samples, have a rapid turnaround time, be easy to dispose of and use portable readers. Paper biosensors can be destroyed by incineration which is important to meet biosafety regulations. Readers should also be easily disinfected, especially for decentralized testing. Wearable biosensors would enable the continuous monitoring of patients, a  much-desired feature, however the technology still needs further development to be ready for clinical translation. The information  provided by these devices should then be combined with patient data (age, comorbidities, treatments, microbiology results) in order to assess the risk of a bad prognosis. Using the information from these biosensors to train a neural network has the potential to achieve this goal.""

For a COVID-19 positive mother who wishes to pump or express breast milk:
•The mother can express breastmilk after carefully washing both her breasts and hands. Breastmilk can then be fed to the infant by a non-infected caregiver. 
•Breast pumps should be cleaned thoroughly.

If a COVID-19 positive mother is discharged and the baby remains in the NICU:
•The mother cannot visit her baby until she has had two negative virus tests, 24-hours apart.
•The infant can be fed expressed breast milk, donor breast milk, or formula. Breast milk pumped at home can only be used once the mother is clinically cleared from the virus.
